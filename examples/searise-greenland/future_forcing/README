Scripts here prepare future climate forcing data from SeaRISE for use with PISM.
The input data is the AOGCM mean from IPCC AR4 runs, namely the global climate
file (NetCDF) from the SeaRISE site.  See more at:
  http://websrv.cs.umt.edu/isis/index.php/Future_Climate_Data

The sequence to do in this directory is:
  $ ./download.sh
  $ ./preprocess.py
  $ ./average.py
to generate these two files
  ar4_temp_anomaly.nc
  ar4_precip_anomaly.nc
And these files should go at these URLs so that the scripts in
../ = examples/searise-greenland/ will work correctly:
  http://www.pism-docs.org/download/ar4_temp_anomaly.nc
  http://www.pism-docs.org/download/ar4_precip_anomaly.nc

The following are more detailed descriptions.

* preprocess.py:
    0)   REQUIRES python modules:
           numpy          : included with most python distributions
           pyproj         : debian package python-pyproj; see http://code.google.com/p/pyproj/
           griddata       : see http://code.google.com/p/griddata-python/
           netcdf4-python : see http://code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python/
         (Thanks whitaker...@gmail.com!)
    i)   reads temperature, precipitation and surface elevation data obtained
           from the AR4 AOGCM mean, which is on a lon,lat grid
    ii)  extracts Greenland region and projects (and thus interpolates) data
           onto the SeaRISE model domain, but on a coarse-ish 50km grid
    iii) writes precip.nc with monthly ice-equivalent precipitation rates,
           and temp.nc with monthly 2m air temperatures

* average.py:
    0)   REQUIRES python modules:  numpy, netcdf4-python
    i)   reads monthly data produced by preprocess.py
    ii)  computes annual averages
    iii) subtracts first year values to give anomalies
    iv)  writes mean annual 2m air temperature and mean annual precipitation
         rate anomalies to files ar4_temp_anomaly.nc and ar4_precip_anomaly.nc

See ../preprocess.sh.  It scales these files for SeaRISE experiments C2,C3,C4.
