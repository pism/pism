PISM Storglaciaren example.

Here we provide a 3D example that uses cryo-hydrologic warming. To get started, run:
  $ ./preprocess.sh

Then spinup the test case by running:

  $ ./run_spinup.sh N         # N processors

Now compare 1K warming over 100 years with and without cryo-hydrologic warming

  $ ./run_ch.sh N         # N processors
