These are minimal scripts, for now.  They are less than needed for an actual
SeaRISE submission.  Spinup (esp. thermodynamical) is not seriously addressed.

See
  http://websrv.cs.umt.edu/isis/index.php/Present_Day_Antarctica
for a description of the data being used.

To use,

  $ ./preprocess.sh   # downloads with wget and NCO to preprocess to PISM-ready

  $ ./antspin.sh N    # 30km grid run with N processes; first stage essentially
                      #   smooths surface, while second stage actually uses
                      #   full physics: sliding plus PIK calving front physics

To do 15km run do "./antspin.sh N 1".  And "./antspin.sh N 2" gives 10km run.
The modifications needed to run on 5km are easy, but require a big
computer and a lot of processor-hours!
