class ModelVecs:
  """A dictionary of :cpp:class:`IceModelVec`\s containing model data.  This plays
  a similar role as the C++ :cpp:class:`Vars` with the key difference that it keeps
  references to its contents.  By contrast, if an :cpp:class:`IceModelVec` is created in python
  and added to a :cpp:class:`Vars`, and if no other reference to the python object is kept, the
  :cpp:class:`IceModelVec` will be deleted, leaving a null pointer lurking in the :cpp:class:`Vars`.
  See method :meth:`asPISMVars` to generate a :cpp:class:`Vars` from the contents of a :class:`ModelVecs`

  The lookup name associated with a vector in a :class:`ModelVecs` has no meaning outside the context of the :class:`ModelVecs`.
  In particular, when converting to a :cpp:class:`Vars`, the lookup names are by default simply the intrinsic
  names of the vectors given at the time of their creation::

    # Construct a tau_c vector with intrinsic name 'tauc'
    yieldstress = PISM.IceModelVec2S()
    yieldstress.create(grid, 'tauc', PISM.WITHOUT_GHOSTS)
    yieldstress.set_attrs("diagnostic", desc, "Pa", "")

    # Construct a thickness vector with intrinsic name 'thk'
    thickness = PISM.IceModelVec2S()
    thickness.create(grid, 'thk', PISM.WITHOUT_GHOSTS)
    thickness.set_attrs("model_state", "land ice thickness", "m", "land_ice_thickness")
    thickness.metadata().set_double("valid_min", 0.0)

    vecs = PISM.model.ModelVecs()

    # Add 'yieldstress' to be accessed via the given name 'basal_yield_stress'
    vecs.add(yieldstress, 'basal_yield_stress')

    # Add 'thickness' to be accessed by its intrinsic name, (i.e. 'thk')
    vecs.add(thickness)

    # Access the vectors
    v1 = vecs.basal_yield_stress
    v2 = vecs.thk

    # Convert to a Vars
    pismVars = vecs.asPISMVars()

    # At this point, pismVars contains two vectors that can be accessed by their intrinsic names.
    w1 = vecs.get('tauc')
    w2 = vecs.get('thk')

  See also :meth:`setPISMVarsName` for associating an alternate name for a member vector to be given when
  converting to a :cpp:class:`Vars`.  And see also functions :func:`createYieldStressVec` and friends
  for one step creation of standard PISM vecs.
