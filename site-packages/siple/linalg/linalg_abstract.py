class AbstractVector:
    """
    Defines the interface that a vector is required to implement for use in the
    inverse problem routines.  Typically a subclass will have a member variable
    that contains a class that is the concrete representation of the vector (e.g.
    a FEniCS Function or a PETSc Vec) and translates the AbstractVector methods
    to operations on its concrete data.

    An abstract vector does not have a notion of of an assoiciated basis, so
    it does not make sense to access the 'coefficients' of an abstract vector.
    Hence there is no operator[] associated with an AbstractVector.

    When the underlying vector is needed, use the core() method to access it.
