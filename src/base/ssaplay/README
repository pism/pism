The various sources here are for reference and ideas on re-implementation,
abstraction, and new application of the SSA equations.  None are currently
being built with PISM.

edstressbalance/*: half-assed attempt in 2010 to clean up

iMinverse.cc,iMinverseMat.cc:  new code to attempt ad hoc inversion with SSA;
  will replace with principled version based on MacAyeal/Maxwell ideas
  
iMssaSNES.cc:  another of Ed's half-assed attempts

iceCalvBCModel.[hh|cc]: Contains some early ideas about calving front
  forces.  The basic idea of a smoothed version of the (thk>0) mask, for calving
  front normal direction, is fine.  The matrix and rhs assembly is now (r1071)
  bogus and should not be used.  Instead of all of this:  merge with PISM-PIK.
  Note that exactTestM.[h|c] exact solution code remains in src/verif/tests/,
  which is fine for reference, but it is not called by pismv.cc in r1072 and
  later.
