This directory contains example PETSc source codes, some 
copied straight from PETSc (like the Bratu example, in different PETSc
versions).  Others are by the PISM authors but are close
to PETSc example codes anyway.  All of these examples relate to "PETSc-
technicalities" of relevance to PISM.

Compiling and running these allows a user to test whether PETSc
itself is installed properly, as a way of testing
PETSc before building PISM.

The following usage examples should work if PETSc 2.3.3 or 3.0.? or 3.1.?
is installed properly, even if other libraries needed by PISM are not yet
installed (e.g. NetCDF, FFTW).


-----------------------
REGARDING PETSC VERSIONS
-----------------------

The makefile in this directory demostrates how we determine which make
system to use.  There is at least one significant difference between the
make system in PETSc 2.3.3 and 3.0.0.  Also incompatibilities in the API.
If using 3.0.0 try:

$ make ex5_petsc3
$ ./ex5_petsc3
Number of Newton iterations = 4

Note poisson.c has a precompiler directive to work under either 2.3.3 
or 3.0.0.  localVecMax.c works unmodified under either.

Here is an example only for 2.3.3 or earlier:

$ make ex5_petsc2  # Bratu DA/SNES example from PETSc
$ ./ex5_petsc2
Number of Newton iterations = 4

BUILD ERRORS
-----------------------
If there is an error 
   "makefile: ... /bmake/common/base: No such file or directory"
or similar then
   ***  PETSC_DIR is not set properly  ***
   ***  see PISM Installation Manual  ***

If there is an error
   "..../bmake/FOO/petscconf: No such file or directory"
or similar then
   ***  PETSC_ARCH is not set properly (as it is set to FOO)  ***
   ***  see PISM Installation Manual  ***
