This is a place to put under-development "tracer module" stuff.

A "tracer module" is going to be a PISM class which uses
the velocity field produced by the stress balance parts of PISM.
That velocity field advects tracers like
  * 3D ice age (relevant to validation-by-isochrone and also grain size)
  * 3D isotopic ratios (see S. Jamieson email 6 Nov. 2012)
  * 2D fracture density (compare Albrecht & Levermann, 2012)

A key idea is that these tracers *do not* diffuse.

This PISM class will presumably take advantage of the fact that the
ice velocity field in 3D is incompressible, namely
  div (u,v,w) = 0.
Because of that, the equations
  A_t + (u,v,w) . grad A = r.h.s.
and
  A_t + div((u,v,w) A) = r.h.s.
for some tracer with value A(t,x,y,z).  So the code can "take advantage"
of the fact that we can imagine
  q = (u,v,w) A
is a "conserved flux", up to changes from the r.h.s.

A closely-related class might also address the 3D enthalpy problem
in which the there is vertical conduction and advection but only advection
in horizontal directions.

A derived class might be appropriate to a 2D (map-plane) advection problem
like that in Albrecht & Levermann (2012).  Here the map-plane 2D velocity field,
i.e. the vertical average of the 3D velocity field, is not incompressible;
generally div (bar u,bar v) is not zero.
