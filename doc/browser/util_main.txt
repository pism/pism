/*! \mainpage PISM utility classes (grid, I/O, etc)

This source code browser documents PISM classes that create the infrastructure
for PISM's code implementing physical models. These classes are not
ice-sheet-modeling specific and can be used as a separate library.

Click on "Classes" above to see the full list of classes in this library; for a
list of key classes, see below.

- IceGrid
- IceModelVec2S, IceModelVec2V, IceModelVec3 and IceModelVec3Bedrock
- PISMComponent, PISMComponent_Diag and PISMComponent_TS
- Timeseries
- NCTool
- PISMIO

The following pages describe some important classes and their intended uses.

- \ref computational_grid "Organization of PISM's computational grid"
- \ref imv_allocation "IceModelVec and friends: storing, reading, writing, accessing 2D and 3D fields"
- \ref pism_components "PISM's model components and their interface"
- \ref timeseries_overview "Reading scalar time-series (Timeseries)"
- \ref nctool_overview "Low-level NetCDF access (NCTool)"
- \ref pismio_overview "Reading and writing gridded data (PISMIO)"
