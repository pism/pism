This searchable *Browser* shows the C++ class (object) structure of
PISM, the [Parallel Ice Sheet Model](http://www.pism-docs.org/).  It
shows all the classes, inheritance structure, source files,
and class members (variables and methods) in the PISM source code.
It was automatically generated by [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/)
from comments in the PISM source code.  It is the source of PISM technical
information, including that needed to extend PISM functionality.

Click on "Classes" above to see the full list of classes in this library.  Some
key classes include:

### The "manager" class

The IceModel class manages time-stepping, I/O, initialization, and
contains parts of the model that were not modularized yet.

Many aspects of PISM's behavior can be modified by writing a new class
derived from IceModel and re-implementing one or more of its methods.

### Major sub-models

See these classes, as well as *the ones derived from these*. (This is
a summary.)

- PISMStressBalance, ShallowStressBalance, SSB_Modifier (stress
  balance models)
- PISMHydrology (sub-glacial hydrology models)
- PISMBedDef (bed deformation models)
- PISMYieldStress, IceBasalResistancePlasticLaw (basal strength)
- PISMCalvingAtThickness, PISMEigenCalving, PISMFloatKill,
  PISMOceanKill, PISMIcebergRemover (calving and "iceberg removal")
- IceFlowLaw (rheology)

#### Climatic inputs

- PISMSurfaceModel ("surface" models, i.e. melt and snow processes)
- PISMAtmosphereModel ("atmosphere", provides inputs to a PISMSurfaceModel)
- PISMOceanModel ("ocean" model, provides sub-shelf boundary
  conditions, melange back-pressure, and sea level elevation)

### Infrastructure (utility) classes

- IceGrid (computational grid)
- PISMComponent and PISMComponent_TS (interface shared by most sub-models)
- IceModelVec2S, IceModelVec2Stag, IceModelVec2V, and IceModelVec3 (storage)
- Timeseries (scalar forcing)
- IceModelVec2T (2D time-dependent forcing)
- NCVariable (variable metadata such as physical units)
- PISMConfig (configuration parameter database)
- PISMTime (time management, including calendars)
- PIO (file I/O)

### Some important infrastructure concepts and techniques:

- [Organization of PISM's computational grid](@ref computational_grid)
- [IceModelVec and friends: storing, reading, writing, accessing 2D and 3D fields](@ref icemodelvec_use)
- [PISM's model components and their interface](@ref pism_components)
- [Reading scalar time-series (Timeseries)](@ref timeseries_overview)

### Other useful pages

The [Related Pages tab](pages.html) links to some
overview pages for PISM usage and design.  You will find
- [table of standard names used by PISM](@ref std_names),
- [table of configuration parameters for PISM](@ref config),
- ['how do I?' page for developers](@ref howto),
- [list of References](@ref references), and other helpful material.

This doxygen source *Browser* can be regenerated in any source code release.
Just do `"make browser"` in the build directory and look in
`doc/browser/html/` therein.

### Where to go next (other PISM documentation)

- The website [www.pism-docs.org](http://www.pism-docs.org/) is the
  *root* for all PISM information.

- You can *get help,* send comments, or ask for new features by email to
  help@pism-docs.org.

- To *download* the PISM source code see https://github.com/pism/pism.
  Use of [Git](http://git-scm.com/) to download is strongly
  recommended because, even for the stable branches of the code, bug
  fixes are easy to distribute by `" git pull "`.

- For help *installing* PISM, see the
  [PISM Installation Manual](http://www.pism-docs.org/).

- For help *using* PISM, see the
  [PISM User's Manual](http://www.pism-docs.org/). The *User's Manual*
  should suffice for understanding PISM unless one wants to modify it
  or couple another model to it.
