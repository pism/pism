\section adding_parameters Creating  and using configuration flags and parameters

\li Edit 'src/pism_config.cdl'. Each flag or parameter is stored as a NetCDF attribute and should have a corresponding "_doc" attribute describing its meaning.

\verbatim
    pism_config:standard_gravity = 9.81;
    pism_config:standard_gravity_doc = "m s-2; acceleration due to gravity on Earth geoid";
\endverbatim

\li One can access these parameters using the NCConfigVariable class. IceModel
has an instance of this class as a data member 'config', so no additional code is
necessary to initialize the configuration database.

To use a parameter, do
\code
double g = config.get("standard_gravity");
\endcode

To use a flag, do
\code
bool compute_age = config.get_flag("do_age");
\endcode


\note
\li It is a good idea to avoid calling config.get() and config.get_flag()
from within loops: looking up a parameter by its name is slow.
\li Please see \ref config "this page" for a list of flags and parameters
currently used in PISM.

\section adding_variables Creating and using additional variables.

\subsection standalone_code Creating IceModelVec instances.

PISM uses the following classes to manage 2D and 3D fields, their I/O and
metadata:

\li IceModelVec2S -- scalar 2D fields
\li IceModelVec2V -- vector 2D fields (such as horizontal velocities;
corresponds to 2 NetCDF variables)
\li IceModelVec2Mask -- 2D masks, such as the grounded/floating mask
\li IceModelVec3 -- scalar 3D fields (within the ice)
\li IceModelVec3Bedrock -- scalar 3D fields within the bedrock thermal layer

Please see the documentation of these classes for more info.

To create a scalar field, for example, one needs to create an instance of one
of the classes listed above and then call "create" to allocate it.

\code
  // land ice thickness
  ierr = vH.create(grid, "thk", true, 2); CHKERRQ(ierr);
  ierr = vH.set_attrs("model_state", "land ice thickness",
		      "m", "land_ice_thickness"); CHKERRQ(ierr);
  ierr = vH.set_attr("valid_min", 0.0); CHKERRQ(ierr);
\endcode

Here \c grid is an IceGrid instance, "thk" is the name of the NetCDF variable,
"true" corresponds to "has ghosts" and "2" is the number of ghosts (in other
words: needed stencil width).

You don't need to de-allocate variables unless you dynamically created the
IceModelVec2S object using the C++ "new" operator.

The IceModelVec destructor takes care of undoing all that's done by the
create() call.

The next call sets variable metadata you will see in an output file
\li \b pism_intent  -- the only important case is "model_state", see below
\li \b long_name -- the (descriptive) long name used for plotting, etc
\li \b units -- units used \e in \e the \e code. Does not have to match units
in a file
\li \b standard_name -- CF standard name.

If you want PISM to automatically convert data from the units used in an input file to the
units used internally, you need to add

\code
  ierr = vH.set_glaciological_units("km"); CHKERRQ(ierr);
\endcode

If, in addition to this, you want PISM to \e write data using "glaciological"
units, add
\code
vH.write_in_glaciological_units = true;
\endcode

\subsubsection reading_more Reading data from a file.

There are two cases of "reading data from a file":
\li reading a field stored on a grid matching the one used by the current run
(restarting a run is one example) and
\li reading a field stored on a different grid, interpolating onto the current
grid.

This snippet from PAYearlyCycle::init() covers both cases (at least for
surface, atmosphere and ocean models; i.e. for all the classes derived from PISMComponent)
\code
  ierr = find_pism_input(precip_filename, lic, regrid, start); CHKERRQ(ierr);

  // read precipitation rate from file
  ierr = verbPrintf(2, grid.com, 
		    "    reading mean annual ice-equivalent precipitation rate 'precip'\n"
		    "      from %s ... \n",
		    precip_filename.c_str()); CHKERRQ(ierr); 
  if (regrid) {
    ierr = precip.regrid(precip_filename.c_str(), *lic, true); CHKERRQ(ierr); // fails if not found!
  } else {
    ierr = precip.read(precip_filename.c_str(), start); CHKERRQ(ierr); // fails if not found!
  }
  string precip_history = "read from " + precip_filename + "\n";

  ierr = precip.set_attr("history", precip_history); CHKERRQ(ierr);

  delete lic;
\endcode

Here
\li "lic" stands for LocalInterpCtx, a "local interpolation context"
containing information needed to interpolate from the grid in "precip_filename".
\li "start" is an index of a record \e within \e a \e file that we need to
read. PISM almost always reads the last record.

Please see PISMComponent::find_pism_input() to see how to create a "local
interpolation context" and compute the "start" index.

\subsubsection writing_more Writing data to a file.

To write a field stored in an IceModelVec to a file, just call

\code 
    ierr = precip.write(filename); CHKERRQ(ierr);
\endcode

The file referred to by "filename" here has to have "t", "x", "y", "z", "zb"
dimensions created. You don't need to do this to be able to write to an output
("-o") file, a snapshot file or the like; IceModel takes care of it.

If you do need to "prepare" a file, call
\code
  PISMIO nc(&grid);

  ierr = nc.open_for_writing(filename, false, true); CHKERRQ(ierr);
  // append == false, check_dims == true
  ierr = nc.append_time(grid.year); CHKERRQ(ierr);
  ierr = nc.close(); CHKERRQ(ierr);
\endcode

Here,
\li append == false means that if a file exists already, it will be moved
aside
\li check_dims == true means tells PISM to create dimensions. 

A newly created file is "empty" and contains no records. The nc.append_time()
call creates a record corresponding to a particular model year.

\subsection inside_icemodel Creating IceModelVec instances that are data members of IceModel or a derived class.

To add a new variable to IceModel, allocate it in the createVecs() method.

If "pism_intent" is set to "model_state" and a variable is added to the
"variables" dictionary (see PISMVars), IceModel will automatically read this
variable from a file it is re-starting from and will always write it to an
output, snapshot and backup files.

\code
  ierr = variables.add(vH); CHKERRQ(ierr);
\endcode

\section reading_scalar_forcing Reading scalar forcing data

PISM uses instances of the Timeseries class to read scalar forcing data; please
see PAForcing or PA_SeaRISE_Greenland for an example.

The following snippet from PAForcing::init() illustrates creating a Timeseries
object and reading data from a file.

\code
    dTforcing = new Timeseries(grid.com, grid.rank, "delta_T", "t");
    ierr = dTforcing->set_units("Celsius", ""); CHKERRQ(ierr);
    ierr = dTforcing->set_dimension_units("years", ""); CHKERRQ(ierr);
    ierr = dTforcing->set_attr("long_name", "near-surface air temperature offsets");
             CHKERRQ(ierr);

    ierr = verbPrintf(2, grid.com, 
		      "  reading delta T data from forcing file %s...\n", dT_file);
		      CHKERRQ(ierr);
	 
    ierr = dTforcing->read(dT_file); CHKERRQ(ierr);
\endcode

Call
\code
double offset = (*dTforcing)(time);
\endcode
to get the value corresponding to the time "time", in this case in years. The
value returned will be computed using linear interpolation.

\section reading_2d_forcing Reading 2D forcing fields

PISM uses instances of the IceModelVec2T class to read 2D forcing fields;
please see PSDirectForcing for an example.

The following snippet from PSDirectForcing::init() illustrates creating an
IceModelVec2T object and reading data from a file.

\code
  temperature.set_n_records((unsigned int) config.get("climate_forcing_buffer_size"));
  ierr = temperature.create(grid, "artm", false); CHKERRQ(ierr);
  ierr = temperature.set_attrs("climate_forcing",
                               "temperature of the ice at the ice surface but below firn processes",
                               "Kelvin", ""); CHKERRQ(ierr);
  ierr = temperature.init(filename); CHKERRQ(ierr);
\endcode
