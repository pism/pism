/*! \page bombproofenth BOMBPROOF, a numerical scheme for conservation of energy (ENTHALPY DEV VERSION)

\section intro Introduction: The need for a \e very stable scheme, even if not very accurate

One of the essential goals for any thermomechanically-coupled numerical ice sheet model 
is a completely bombproof numerical 
scheme for the advection-conduction-reaction problem for the conservation of
energy within the ice and the bedrock.  The conservation of energy problem here
is described in terms of the enthalpy field.
  
"Bombproof" means being, roughly, as stable as possible in as many realistic modeling
contexts as possible.  PISM illustrates this idea by including a scheme which is 
observed to be highly robust in practice but also provably stable in a significant
range of circumstances.  The scheme is special to shallow ice sheets
because it makes specific tradeoff choices with respect to vertical velocity, though
it is generic and low order with respect to horizontal velocity.

In this page we will state the scheme, prove its stability properties, and specify
the nontrivial modifications needed at the ice-bedrock transition.

Accuracy is also a goal, but it is necessarily a second goal.  It is partly achieved 
here because our scheme has truncation error \f$O(\Delta z^2)\f$
in many circumstances, though it reverts to lower order when it "detects trouble"
in the form of large vertical velocities.  More completely stated, the scheme has 
order \f$O(\Delta t,\Delta x,\Delta y, \Delta z^2)\f$ in circumstances where the vertical
ice flow velocity is small enough, relative to conductivity.

The finite difference scheme in this section supercedes the PISM scheme for the 
temperature equation described in the appendices of [\ref BBL].  That scheme 
is robust but it has a CFL condition on vertical advection, an avoidable time step 
restriction.  The CFL condition on horizontal advection
remains in the new scheme, however.  The scheme here is conditionally stable 
as an adaptive time-stepping technique for the 3D conservation of energy equation.
The length of the time step is limited only by the maximum magnitude of the 
horizontal velocities within the ice.

The ice %region in which the energy equation needs to be solved, at least within 
the ice sheet and attached ice shelves, generally changes over time.  This is an 
essential complicating factor in ice sheet modeling.  According to user options, 
there may also be a model for the energy within a layer of bedrock 
below the ice sheet.  The implementation must accommodate these possibilities.

Equally essential is the fact that the velocity field has a
complicated provenance.  It comes from a variety of stress
balance equations.  These stress balances, especially where there is a transition 
in stress balance type, like at grounding lines, are incompletely understood.
The stress balance could be the SIA, the SSA, a mix of these in different parts of the
ice sheet/shelf system, or an even less shallow model in future PISM versions.

We will not make, and we need to \e not make, assumptions
about the regularity of the velocity field in space or time.  Nor do we want 
the numerical scheme for advection to need any information about the velocity
except its value at the beginning of the time step.  Thus we would not 
accept a scheme which required the Jacobian
of the velocity field with respect to changes in energy, for example.
At very least we cannot implement a fully implicit scheme without some 
blind iteration (%e.g. with no guarantee of convergence of the iteration), while 
the scheme we propose involves no iteration.


\section iceequations Conservation of energy in a shallow ice sheet

In terms of the specific enthalpy field \f$E(x,y,z,t)\f$, which has units of 
\f$J\,\text{kg}^{-1}\f$ in SI, the energy equation is [\ref AschwandenBlatter2009]

\anchor basicEnergy
  \f[ \rho \frac{dE}{dt} = -\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} + Q,\tag{basicEnergy} \f]
where \f$\rho\f$ is the material density.  The heat flux in cold ice, temperate ice,
and bedrock is
\anchor heatflux
  \f[ \mathbf{q} = \begin{cases}
                      - k_i c_i^{-1} \nabla E, & \text{cold ice}, \\
                      0, & \text{temperate ice}, \tag{heatflux} \\
                      - k_b c_b^{-1} \nabla E, & \text{bedrock}, \\
                   \end{cases} \f]
where \f$k_i,c_i,k_b,c_b\f$ are all constant.  Note \f$dE/dt\f$ stands for the material
derivative of the enthalpy field,
  \f[ \frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \mathbf{U}\cdot \nabla E, \f] 
so advection \e is present.

In ice the additive quantity \f$Q\f$ is just the bulk strain (dissipation) heating.  For
historical reasons (consistency with [\ref BBL, \ref BBssasliding]) we denote the strain
heating term by \f$\Sigma\f$.  Without making any shallow approximations, the exact
formula for this is
  \f[ \Sigma = \sum_{i,j=1}^3 D_{ij} \tau_{ij} \f] 
where \f$D_{ij}\f$ is the strain rate tensor and \f$\tau_{ij}\f$ is the deviatoric stress
tensor.  References [\ref BBL, \ref BBssasliding] address how this term is computed in PISM,
according to the shallow stress balance approximation which is active.
Within the PISM source code, see methods IceModel::velocitySIAStaggered() and
IceModel::correctSigma().

In a sliding model with an ice-bedrock interface, the friction of the sliding also is a
source of heating.  It has units of W m-2 = J s-1 m-2, that is, heating per area.
In formulas we write
  \f[ F_b = - \tau_b \cdot \mathbf{u}_b \,\delta_0(z), \f]
where \f$\tau_b\f$ is the basal shear stress, \f$\mathbf{u}_b\f$ is the basal sliding velocity,
and \f$\delta_0(z)\f$ is the usual Dirac delta "function", with the property that
\f$\int_a^b \delta(z)\,dz = 1\f$ if \f$a<0<b\f$.  This delta function indicates that the
friction heating is concentrated at \f$z=0\f$.  Note that the basal shear stress is
oppositely-directed to the basal velocity.  For example,
in the plastic case \f$\tau_b = - \tau_c \mathbf{u}_b / |\mathbf{u}_b|\f$ where
\f$\tau_c\f$ is a positive scalar, the yield stress.  (Within the PISM source code, 
see methods IceModel::basalSlidingHeatingSIA() and IceModel::correctBasalFrictionalHeating().
The former is only called by IceModel::velocity() if IceModel::muSliding > 0, which is
not generally recommended [see Appendix B of \ref BBssasliding].)

When considering the ice-bedrock interface, the term \f$Q\f$ will appear only under a
volume integral.  Therefore the delta function in the expression for \f$F_b\f$ will be
correctly handled.  In summary, our additive heat sources have the form
  \f[ Q = \Sigma + F_b, \f]
and this is what appears in equation (\ref basicEnergy).  Note \f$Q=0\f$ in the bedrock
thermal layer.

The units of equation (\ref basicEnergy), and of the quantity \f$Q\f$, are
\f$J\,\text{s}^{-1}\,\text{m}^{-3}\f$ in SI.

The shallow approximation we use, of equation (\ref basicEnergy), lacks horizontal
conduction terms  [\ref Fowler].  Also, for the initial analysis of the core BOMBPROOF
scheme, we specialize to cold ice and we do not consider the bedrock thermal layer.
Within cold ice the coefficient in the heat flux is constant, so
  \f[ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = - k_i c_i^{-1} \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial z^2}. \f]
Therefore the equation we initially analyze is

\anchor basicShallow
\f[
\rho_i \frac{dE}{dt} = k_i c_i^{-1} \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial z^2} + Q,\tag{basicShallow}
\f]

We will assume, without exception, that \f$\rho_i\f$ and \f$c_i\f$ are positive.

We will be focusing on the direction in which the enthalpy and temperature has largest spatial gradient, 
namely with respect to the vertical coordinate \f$z\f$.  Rewriting equation (\ref basicShallow)
to emphasize the vertical terms we have

\anchor vertProblem
\f{align*}
\rho_i \left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + w \frac{\partial E}{\partial z}\right) 
     &= k_i c_i^{-1}  \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial z^2} + \Phi \tag{vertProblem}
 \f}
where
\f[
\Phi = Q - \rho_i \left(u \frac{\partial E}{\partial x}
                         + v \frac{\partial E}{\partial y}\right)
\f]

The boundary conditions to problem (\ref vertProblem) are a surface temperature
condition at the top of the ice and a geothermal flux condition at the bottom of the ice.
(Only at the end will we consider the bedrock thermal layer.)  Within cold ice
the enthalpy and the temperature are linearly related,
  \f[ T(H,p) = c_i^{-1} (E-E_s(p)) + T_m(p) = c_i^{-1} E, \f]
because the enthalpy is normalized by \f$E_s(p) = c_i T_m(p)\f$.  (See documentation
on the EnthalpyConverter class.)  We will assume that in reasonably realistic ice sheet modeling
situations the surface temperature \f$T_s(t,x,y)\f$ (K) and the geothermal flux
\f$G(t,x,y)\f$ (W m-2) are given.  Thus for cold ice, and no bedrock
thermal layer,

\anchor columnbcs
\f[
E(t,z=H) = c_i T_s, \qquad -k_i c_i^{-1} \frac{\partial E}{\partial z}\Big|_{z=0} = G.\tag{columnbcs}
\f]


\section corebombproof The core BOMBPROOF scheme

For the discussion of the numerical scheme below, let \f$E_{ijk}^n\f$ be our approximation to 
the exact enthalpy \f$E\f$ at the grid point with coordinates \f$(x_i,y_j,z_k)\f$ at 
time \f$t_n\f$.  When \f$i,j\f$ are uninteresting we will suppress them and write \f$E_k^n\f$.  
We will use similar notation for numerical approximations to the other quantities, like
velocity components \f$u,v,w\f$ and \f$\Phi\f$.  We put the horizontal advection terms in 
the source term \f$\Phi\f$ because we treat it explicitly, evaluating at time \f$t_n\f$.
(Implicit or semi-implicit treatment of horizontal advection would
require a coupled system distributed across processors.  That kind of numerical difficulty
can be avoided, even given the other constraints on accuracy and implementation.)

The scheme we use for horizontal advection is explicit first-order upwinding.  
There is a CFL condition for the scheme to be stable, 
based on the magnitude of the horizontal velocity components, namely (\ref CFL) below.

To state the upwind scheme itself, let
  \f[\Up{f_{\bullet}}{\alpha_i} = \begin{cases}
                                     f_i-f_{i-1}, & \alpha_i\ge 0, \\
                                     f_{i+1}-f_i, & \alpha_i<0.
                                  \end{cases}\f]
(This is a slightly different definition of \f$\Up{f_{\bullet}}{\alpha_i}\f$
from that used in the appendices of [\ref BBL], though with exactly the same intent.)
The approximate horizontal advection terms, and thus the approximation to the whole
term \f$\Phi\f$, is stated using this upwind notation as
	\f[\Phi_{ijk}^n = \Sigma_{ijk}^n - \rho_i 
	                   \left( u_{ijk}^n\,\frac{\Up{E_{\bullet jk}^n}{u_{ijk}^n}}{\Delta x}
	                          + v_{ijk}^n\,\frac{\Up{E_{i\bullet k}^n}{v_{ijk}^n}}{\Delta y} \right).\f]

The CFL stability condition for this part of the scheme is
\anchor CFL
\f[
    \Delta t \,\left( \left|\frac{u_{ijk}^n}{\Delta x}\right|
                           + \left|\frac{v_{ijk}^n}{\Delta y}\right| \right) \le 1.\tag{CFL}
\f]
The routine IceModel::computeMax3DVelocities() computes the 
maximum of velocity magnitudes.  This produces a time step restriction based on 
the above CFL condition.  Then IceModel::determineTimeStep() 
implements adaptive time-stepping based on this and other stability criteria.

In the analysis below we will assume an equally-spaced grid \f$z_0,\dots,z_{M_z}\f$
with \f$\Delta z = z_{k+1} - z_k\f$.  In fact PISM has a remapping scheme in each 
column, wherein the enthalpy in a column of ice is stored on an unequally-spaced 
vertical grid, but is mapped to a fine, equally-spaced grid for the conservation of energy
computation described here.  (Similar structure applies to the age computation.)  See procedures 
IceEnthalpyModel::enthalpyAndDrainageStep() and IceModel::ageStep(), and see
the IceModelVec3 class and IceGrid::getFineEqualVertLevsIce().  (Options -quadZ and 
-chebZ choose unequally-spaced storage vertical grids.)

The \f$z\f$ derivative terms in (\ref vertProblem) will be approximated implicitly.  Let
\f$\lambda\f$ be in the interval \f$0 \le \lambda \le 1\f$.  The scheme BOMBPROOF is
\anchor bombone
\f{align*}
\rho_i &\left( 
       \frac{E_k^{n+1} - E_k^n}{\Delta t}
       + \lambda w_k^n \frac{E_{k+1}^{n+1} - E_{k-1}^{n+1}}{2 \Delta z}
       + (1-\lambda) w_k^{n} \frac{\Up{E_{\bullet}^{n+1}}{w_k^{n}}}{\Delta z} \right) \\
     &= k_i c_i^{-1}\, \frac{E_{k+1}^{n+1} - 2 E_{k}^{n+1} + E_{k-1}^{n+1}}{\Delta z^2} + \Phi_k^n \tag{bombone}
\f}
with the value for \f$\lambda\f$ determined by (\ref lambdachoice) below.
We have suppressed indices \f$i,j\f$.

Equation (\ref bombone) includes two approximations of vertical advection, combined 
using nonnegative coefficients which sum to one.  Both approximations are
(semi-)implicit, but the centered formula has higher accuracy,
	\f[w_k^n \frac{E_{k+1}^{n+1} - E_{k-1}^{n+1}}{2 \Delta z}
	   = w \frac{\partial E}{\partial z} + O(\Delta t,\Delta z^2),\f]
while the first order upwind formula has lower accuracy,
	\f[w_k^{n} \frac{\Up{E_{\bullet}^{n+1}}{w_k^{n}}}{\Delta z}
	   = w \frac{\partial E}{\partial z} + O(\Delta t,\Delta z).\f]
We prefer for accuracy reasons to use the centered formula, because it has 
higher order truncation error.  We will only include (implicit) upwinding when
it is needed for its added stability benefits.  This is done by the choice of
\f$\lambda\f$ below.

Let
	\f[ \nu = \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta z},
	 \qquad \text{and} \qquad R = \frac{k_i \Delta t}{\rho_i c_i \Delta z^2}.\f]
We now rewrite (\ref bombone) for computational purposes as one of a system of equations 
for the unknowns \f$\{E_k^{n+1}\}\f$.  In the new system the coefficients will be
scaled so that the diagonal entries of the matrix have limit one as
\f$\Delta t\to 0\f$.  That is, we multiply equation (\ref bombone) by
\f$\Delta t\f$, divide it by \f$\rho_i\f$, and rearrange:
\anchor bombtwo
\f{align*}
&\left(-R - \nu w_k^n \uppair{1-\lambda/2}{\lambda/2}\right) E_{k-1}^{n+1}  
   + \left(1 + 2 R + \nu w_k^n (1-\lambda) \uppair{+1}{-1}\right) E_k^{n+1} \tag{bombtwo} \\
&\qquad\qquad + \left(-R + \nu w_k^n \uppair{\lambda/2}{1-\lambda/2} \right) E_{k+1}^{n+1}
    = E_k^n + \Delta t \rho_i^{-1}\Phi_k^n 
\f}
Here \f$\uppair{a}{b} = a\f$ when \f$w_k^n\ge 0\f$ and \f$\uppair{a}{b} = b\f$ when \f$w_k^n < 0\f$.

Either of equivalent Equations (\ref bombone) or (\ref bombtwo) combines two unconditionally 
stable ways of approximating vertical advection, namely implicit centered difference 
(\f$\lambda = 1\f$) and implicit first-order upwinding (\f$\lambda=0\f$).  The combination 
is "convex" because the coefficients are nonnegative and sum to one.

Regarding scaling of the equations and units, Equation (\ref bombtwo)
has coefficients which are scaled to have no units.  Equation (\ref bombtwo) is 
ready to be put in the system managed by an enthSystemCtx instance.

The pure implicit centered difference scheme (\f$\lambda=1\f$), namely
\anchor centered
\f{align*}
&\left(-R - \nu w_k^n/2\right) E_{k-1}^{n+1} + \left(1 + 2 R\right) E_k^{n+1} \tag{centered} \\
&\qquad\qquad + \left(-R + \nu w_k^n/2\right) E_{k+1}^{n+1} 
              = E_k^n + \Delta t \rho_i^{-1}\Phi_k^n 
\f}
is <i>less stable</i> than implicit first-order upwinding.  It is less stable 
in the same sense that Crank-Nicolson is a less stable scheme than 
backwards Euler for the simplest heat equation \f$u_t = u_{xx}\f$ [\ref MortonMayers].
In fact, although oscillatory modes cannot grow exponentially under equation (\ref centered),
those modes <i>can</i> appear when none are present already, even in the homogeneous case
\f$\Phi_k^n=0\f$.

One way of stating the greater stability of first-order upwinding is to say it satisfies a 
"maximum principle" [\ref MortonMayers].  An example of a maximum principle for this kind of finite difference 
scheme is that if \f$U_{k-1}^n,U_k^n,U_{k+1}^n\f$ are adjacent gridded values of some
abstract quantity at time step \f$t_n\f$, and if the next value satisfies the scheme
	\f[U_k^{n+1} = C_{-1} U_{k-1}^n + C_0 U_k^n + C_{+1} U_{k+1}^n\f]
for <i>nonnegative</i> coefficients \f$C_i\f$ summing to one, \f$C_{-1} + C_0 + C_{+1} = 1\f$, 
then it follows by the triangle inequality that
	\f[\min\{|U_{k-1}^n|, |U_k^n|, |U_{k+1}^n|\} 
	       \le |U_k^{n+1}| \le \max\{|U_{k-1}^n|, |U_k^n|, |U_{k+1}^n|\}.\f]
Thus a "wiggle" cannot appear in the abstract explicit scheme for \f$\{U_k^n\}\f$.
The proof below shows the corresponding "wiggle-free" property for scheme (\ref bombtwo).


\section theory Stability properties of the BOMBPROOF scheme

We want to be precise about the phrase "unconditionally stable" for BOMBPROOF.
To do so we consider somewhat simplified cases which are amenable to analysis, and
we prove two stability properties, the precise advantages of BOMBPROOF.

\subsection stabilitythm Theorem (stating the stability properties).
Assume, for the precise but limited assertion of this theorem,
that the surface temperature \f$T_s\f$ and the geothermal flux \f$G\f$ are constant 
in time and space.  Assume also that the entire source function \f$\Phi\f$ is identically zero 
(but see comments below).  Fix an equally-spaced vertical grid \f$z_0=0 < z_1 < \dots < z_N=H\f$,
so that the upper grid point coincides with the surface of the ice.  Suppose \f$c_p(T)\f$ is
bounded below by a positive constant (so that equation (\ref bombtwo)
is a valid rewriting of equation (\ref bombone)).  With these assumptions, if
\anchor lambdachoice
\f[
\lambda = \min\left\{1, \quad 
	               \min_{k=0,\dots,N}\left\{\frac{2 k_i}{|w_k^n| \rho_i c_i \Delta z}\right\}
	               \quad \right\},\tag{lambdachoice}
\f]
reset at each time step \f$n\f$, then scheme (\ref bombone, \ref bombtwo) is
unconditionally-stable in the following two senses:

<ol>

<li>  A maximum principle applies without further assumptions.</li>
 
<li>  Suppose we freeze the coefficients of the problem to have constant values in
time and space.  (Concretely, we assume that \f$\lambda\f$ is chosen independently
of the time step \f$n\f$, and that \f$\Delta t\f$ is the same for each time step.
We assume constant vertical velocity \f$w_k^n=w_0\f$.  We also consider a spatially-periodic
or unbounded version of our problem, with no boundary conditions.)
Then a von Neumann  analysis of the constant coefficient problem yields 
a growth factor less than one for all modes on the grid.
</li>
</ol>

\subsection remark Remarks.
The phrases <i>maximum principle</i> and <i>von Neumann analysis</i>
will be precisely illustrated in the following proof.  Both approaches are in 
[\ref MortonMayers].  There is additional information on the 
von Neumann analysis of implicit methods for advection in [\ref Strikwerda].

These statements also apply in case \f$k_i=0\f$, in which case (\ref lambdachoice) implies
\f$\lambda=0\f$, and the method reduces to implicit first-order upwinding.  (Implicit
first-order upwinding has properties 1 and 2 [\ref Strikwerda].)  The case \f$k_i=0\f$
is relevant because it applies to temperate ice in which there is no enthalpy conduction.
One reasonable model for temperate ice is to assume no transport of the liquid fraction,
whether diffusive transport or otherwise, and to ignor conduction along the temperature
gradient, because the gradient is only from pressure-melting temperature differences.

\subsection proofone Proof of 1.

In the case considered for the maximum principle, with \f$\Phi_k^n=0\f$, 
we can rewrite (\ref bombtwo) as
\anchor formax
\f{align*}
&\left(1 + 2 R + \nu w_k^n (1-\lambda) \uppair{+1}{-1}\right) E_k^{n+1} \\
&\qquad = E_k^n + \left(R + \nu w_k^n \uppair{1-\lambda/2}{\lambda/2}\right) E_{k-1}^{n+1}
                + \left(R - \nu w_k^n \uppair{\lambda/2}{1-\lambda/2}\right) E_{k+1}^{n+1}.
                \tag{formax}
\f}

We claim that with choice (\ref lambdachoice) for \f$0 \le \lambda \le 1\f$, all 
coefficients in (\ref formax) are nonnegative.  At one extreme, in 
the upwinding case (\f$\lambda=0\f$), all the coefficients are nonnegative.  Otherwise, note that
\f$\nu w_k^n (1-\lambda) \uppair{+1}{-1}\f$ is nonnegative for any valid value 
of \f$\lambda\f$ and for any value of \f$w_k^n\f$, noting the meaning of the \f$\uppair{+1}{-1}\f$
symbol.  Thus the coefficient on the left is always nonnegative.  The coefficient of 
\f$E_{k-1}^{n+1}\f$ is clearly nonnegative for any valid value of \f$\lambda\f$ if \f$w_k^n \ge 0\f$.
The coefficient of \f$E_{k+1}^{n+1}\f$ is clearly nonnegative for any valid value of \f$\lambda\f$ if 
\f$w_k^n \le 0\f$.

Therefore the only concerns are for the coefficient of \f$E_{k-1}^{n+1}\f$ when \f$w_k^n\le 0\f$ and the 
coefficient of \f$E_{k+1}^{n+1}\f$ when \f$w_k^n\ge 0\f$.  But if \f$\lambda\f$ is smaller than 
\f$2k_i/(|w_k^n| \rho_i c_i \Delta z)\f$ then 
\f{align*}
R - \nu |w_k^n| (\lambda/2) &= \frac{k_i \Delta t}{\rho_i c_i \Delta z^2}
	                                       - \frac{\Delta t |w_k^n|}{\Delta z} \frac{\lambda}{2}
	        &\ge \frac{k_i \Delta t}{\rho_i c_i \Delta z^2}
	            - \frac{\Delta t |w_k^n|}{\Delta z} \frac{k_i}{|w_k^n| \rho_i c_i \Delta z} = 0.
\f}

Thus all the coefficients in (\ref formformax) are nonnegative, and a maximum principle applies. 
<b> END OF PROOF OF 1. </b> 

\subsection prooftwo Proof of 2.
As a von Neumann analysis is much more restrictive than the analysis above, we will be brief.  
Let's assume the velocity is downward, \f$w_0<0\f$; the other case is similar.  Equation
(\ref bombtwo) becomes 
\anchor prevon
\f{align*}
&\left(-R - \nu w_0 (\lambda/2)\right) E_{k-1}^{n+1}  
   + \left(1 + 2 R - \nu w_0 (1-\lambda)\right) E_k^{n+1} \\
&\qquad\qquad + \left(-R + \nu w_0 (1-\lambda/2) \right) E_{k+1}^{n+1}  = E_k^n.\tag{prevonN}
\f}

The heart of the von Neumann analysis is the substitution of a growing or decaying
(in time index \f$n\f$) oscillatory mode on the grid of spatial wave number \f$\mu\f$:
	\f[E_k^n = \sigma^n e^{i\mu\,(k\Delta z)}.\f]
Here \f$k\Delta z = z_k\f$ is a grid point.  Such a mode is a solution to (\ref prevon) 
if and only if
\f{align*}
\sigma\Big[  &(-R - \nu w_0(\lambda/2)) e^{-i\mu\Delta z}
	              + (1 + 2 R - \nu w_0 (1-\lambda)) \\
	           &\quad   + (-R  + \nu w_0 (\lambda/2)) e^{+i\mu\Delta z}
	                    + \nu w_0 (1-\lambda) e^{+i\mu\Delta z} \Big] = 1.
\f}
This equation reduces by standard manipulations to
	\f[\sigma = \frac{1}{1 + \left(4 R - 2 \nu w_0 (1-\lambda)\right)\cos^2(\mu \Delta z/2)
	                      + i\,\nu w_0 (1-\lambda/2)\sin(\mu\Delta z)}.\f]
Note \f$4 R - 2 \nu w_0 (1-\lambda) \ge 0\f$ without restrictions on 
numerical parameters \f$\Delta t\f$, \f$\Delta z\f$, because \f$w_0<0\f$ in the 
case under consideration.  Therefore
	\f[|\sigma|^2 = \frac{1}{\left[1 + \left(4 R - 2 \nu w_0 (1-\lambda)\right)

	                      + \left[\nu w_0 (1-\lambda/2)\sin(\mu\Delta z)\right]^2}.\f]
This positive number is less than one, so \f$|\sigma| < 1\f$.  It follows that all
modes decay exponentially.  <b> END OF PROOF OF 2. </b>


\subsection remarktwo Remark about our von Neumann stability analysis.

The constant \f$\lambda\f$ is carefully chosen in (\ref lambdachoice) so that the 
maximum principle <i>(I)</i> applies.  On the other hand, both the 
implicit first-order upwind and the implicit centered difference formulas have
unconditional stability in the von Neumann sense.  The proof of case
<i>(II)</i> above is thus a formality, merely showing that a
convex combination of unconditionally stable (von Neumann sense) schemes is still
unconditionally stable in the same sense.


\subsection maxconsequence Convergence: a consequence of the maximum principle.
 
If we define the pointwise numerical error \f$e_k^n = E_k^n - E(t_n,x_i,y_j,z_k)\f$,
where \f$E(\dots)\f$ is the unknown exact solution (exact enthalpy field) [\ref MortonMayers],
then (\ref formax) implies an equality of the form
	\f[A e_k^{n+1} = e_k^n + B_- e_{k-1}^{n+1} + B_+ e_{k+1}^{n+1} + \Delta t\, \tau_k^n\f]
where \f$\tau_k^n\f$ is the truncation error of the scheme and \f$A,B_\pm\f$ are nonnegative 
coefficients (which need no detail for now).  Note that
	\f[B_- + B_+ = 2 R + \nu w_k^n (1-\lambda) \uppair{+1}{-1}.\f]

Letting \f${\bar e}^n = \max_k |e_k^n|\f$ we have, because of the positivity of coefficients,
\anchor prebound
\f{align*}
&\left(1 + 2 R + \nu w_k^n (1-\lambda) \uppair{+1}{-1}\right)|e_k^{n+1}|  \\
& \qquad\qquad \le {\bar e}^n + \left(2 R + \nu w_k^n (1-\lambda) \uppair{+1}{-1}\right){\bar e}^{n+1}
     + \Delta t\,\bar\tau^n \tag{prebound}
\f}
for all \f$k\f$, where \f$\bar\tau^n = \max_k |\tau_k^n|\f$.  Now let \f$k\f$ be the index for 
which \f$|e_k^{n+1}| = {\bar e}^{n+1}\f$.  For that \f$k\f$ we can replace \f$|e_k^{n+1}|\f$ in 
equation (\ref prebound) with \f${\bar e}^{n+1}\f$.  Subtracting the same quantity from 
each side of the resulting inequality gives
\f[
{\bar e}^{n+1} \le {\bar e}^n + \Delta t\,\bar\tau^n,
\f]
It follows that \f$\bar e^n \le C \Delta t\f$, fo some finite \f$C\f$ if \f$\bar e^0\f$
[\ref MortonMayers].  Thus a maximum principle for BOMBPROOF implies convergence 
in the standard way [\ref MortonMayers].  This convergence proof has the same
assumptions as case 1 in the theorem, and thus it only \e suggests convergence
in any broad range of glaciologically-interesting cases.


\subsection final Final remark: nonzero source term.

Now recall we assumed in Theorem 1 that the entire "source" \f$\Phi_k^n\f$ was identically zero.
Of course this is not realistic.  What we understand is provable, however, is that if a
numerical scheme for a linear advection/conduction equation
	\f[u_t + A u_x = B u_{xx}\f]
is stable in the general sense of numerical schemes for partial differential equations
(%e.g. as defined in subsection 5.5 of [\ref MortonMayers]) then the same scheme is stable 
in the same general sense when applied to the equation with (linear) lower order terms:
	\f[u_t + A u_x = B u_{xx} + C u + D.\f]
A precise statement of this general fact is hard to find in the literature, 
to put it mildly, but theorem 2.2.3 of [\ref Strikwerda] is one interesting case
(\f$B=0\f$ and \f$D=0\f$).  But even the form we state with linear term (\f$C u + D\f$)
is not adequate to the job because of the strongly-nonlinear dependence of \f$\Phi\f$
on the temperature \f$T\f$ [\ref BBL].

Nonetheless the maximum principle is a highly-desirable
form of stability because we can exclude "wiggles" from the finite difference approximations
of the conductive and advective terms, even if the complete physics, with strain heating in particular,
is not yet shown to be non-explosive [\ref BBL].  Recall that, because we use first-order upwinding
on the horizontal advection terms, we can expect maximum principle-type stability behavior of the 
whole scheme.


\section bedrock A finite difference scheme for the bedrock thermal layer

Realistic ice sheet modeling requires the recognition that, because sensible heat flux is proportional
to temperature differences, the time-dependent geothermal contribution to the energy in the ice sheet
is related to the temperature in the ice itself.  This is a feedback mechanism that can,
and should, for completeness, be modeled  [\ref RitzFabreLetreguilly].

For instance, suppose the ice sheet is in a state in which the geothermal flux deep in the
crust is equal to the heat flux into the ice base.  If the ice cools from this state then, 
because the temperature gradient is now greater in magnitude, between the warm bedrock 
and the cooler ice, the ice will for some period receive more than the deep geothermal 
flux rate. Similarly, if the ice warms from the equal state then the temperature difference
with the bedrock has become smaller and the magnitude of the ice basal heat flux
will be less than the deep geothermal rate.

Because the relevant layer of bedrock below an ice sheet is again very shallow, and
because we can neglect all crustal flow, modeling the 
energy content, in our case the enthalpy \f$E(t,x,y,z)\f$, is quite simple.
The equation has only vertical conduction:
  \f[ \rho_b \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} = k_b c_b^{-1}  \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial z^2}. \f]
Here we assume \f$\rho_b,k_b,c_b\f$ are constant material properties.  Note
that EnthalpyConverter includes a choice for converting between enthalpy
and temperature in bedrock: \f$E=E(T,p),\quad T=T(E,p)\f$.  For now the method
choosen is uninteresting.

Because there is no advection, our scheme is easily "bombproof" without choosing 
\f$\lambda\f$, or other complications.  In particular we use the simplest centered 
implicit (backward Euler) scheme and quickly get this scaled form,
\anchor bedrockeqn
\f[ -R_b E_{k-1}^{n+1} + \left(1 + 2 R_b\right) E_k^{n+1} - R_b E_{k+1}^{n+1}
         = E_k^n, \tag{bedrockeqn} \f]
where 
  \f[ R_b = \frac{k_b \Delta t}{\rho_b c_b \Delta z^2}. \f]
This is unconditionally stable (for a pure bedrock problem), and has a maximum
principle, without any further qualification [\ref MortonMayers].
Equation (\ref bedrockeqn) is ready to be put in the system managed by an enthSystemCtx instance.

When there is a bedrock layer of positive thickness, IceGrid::Mbz > 1.  We do
not allow IceGrid::Mbz==2 because we need to separate, by more than just one grid
interval, the ice/base transition location from the location of the application
of the geothermal flux.

The geothermal flux is applied at the bottom of the bedrock, which is where
\c k=0 in enthSystemCtx::solveThisColumn().  See the second of equations
(\ref columnbcs).  At this location we have the following equation, which
modifies the above generic bedrock segment case.  It replaces the flux through the lower
surface of the bottom segment of the column by a known flux:
\anchor geothermalbedeqn
\f[ \left(1 + 2 R_b\right) E_0^{n+1} - 2.0 R_b E_{+1}^{n+1}
         = E_k^n + \frac{2 \Delta t}{\rho_b \Delta z} G. \tag{geothermalbedeqn} \f]
The argument for this equation is standard, involving the introduction
of a virtual value \f$E_{-1}^{n+1}\f$ [\ref MortonMayers].


\section icebedrock A finite difference scheme at the ice-bedrock transition

The ice/bedrock interface requires careful, special analysis, because many physical
processes are reflected in the conservation of energy equation.  For this special
location we must make a somewhat elaborate argument, a finite volume argument, in
order to derive the one algebraic equation, per column, which goes in the system
of equations for that column (see enthSystemCtx).  In particular, because 
the enthalpy has different dependence on temperature in ice and bedrock, there is an
inevitable enthalpy jump at the ice-bedrock transition.  (In fact, \f$\partial E/\partial T\f$
has different values in ice and in bedrock, so we cannot choose normalizations in
ice and in bedrock with the property that there is no jump in enthalpy at the
ice-bedrock interface.)

Consider \ref figure1 "Figure 1" which has volume \f$V\f$ surrounded by a dotted line.
We will integrate our conservation of energy equation
  \f[ \rho \frac{dE}{dt} = -\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} + Q \f]
over \f$V\f$.  Volume \f$V\f$ is between levels \f$z=-\epsilon\f$ and 
\f$z=+\epsilon\f$, where \f$\epsilon=\Delta z/2\f$.  We denote the upper and lower
halves of \f$V\f$ by \f$V^\pm\f$, respectively.

\anchor figure1
\image html enthinterface.png "Figure 1.  At the ice-bedrock transition."

Before integrating over \f$V\f$, recall the different forms for heat flux \f$\mathbf{q}\f$
(\ref heatflux), and the meaning of the material derivative \f$dE/dt\f$.  Also, 
note that the lower half \f$V^-\f$ is boring (only vertical
conduction) while the upper half \f$V^+\f$ is interesting (vertical conduction 
\e plus advection \e plus strain heating).

Now, by the divergence theorem [\ref Schey],
  \f[ \int_{V} \rho \frac{dE}{dt}
        = - \int_V \nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} + \int_V Q
        = - \int_{\partial V} \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{n} + \int_V Q \f]
where \f$\partial V\f$ is the entire boundary
of \f$V\f$, with outward unit normal vector field \f$\mathbf{n}\f$.

The fact that \f$\Delta z \ll \Delta x\f$, which is to say the shallowness of the
continuum model, justifies neglecting the conductive heat flux through the
sides of \f$V\f$ and only integrating over the top and bottom, namely surfaces
\f$S^\pm\f$ in \ref figure1 "Figure 1".  On \f$S^\pm\f$ the outward unit normal
is the vertical unit vector: \f$\mathbf{n}=\pm \mathbf{z}\f$, respectively.
Also, the integral on the left side of the equation breaks into two parts in which
the densities are constant, and only the upper part is a flowing material (with
three-dimensional velocity \f$\mathbf{U}\f$), so the material derivative is 
just the partial derivative in the lower part.  Thus we have
\anchor interface1
  \f[ \rho_i \int_{V^+} \frac{\partial E}{\partial t}
         + \rho_i \int_{V^+} \mathbf{U} \cdot \nabla E
         + \rho_b \int_{V^-} \frac{\partial E}{\partial t}
        = - \int_{S^+} \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{z}
          - \int_{S^-} \mathbf{q} \cdot (-\mathbf{z}) + \int_V Q \tag{interface1}\f]

Let \f$A=\Delta x\Delta y\f$, the cross-sectional area of our column of ice, so
\f$\epsilon A\f$ is the volume of \f$V^+\f$.  We compute the integral of the additive
heating \f$Q\f$: 
  \f[ \int_V Q = \int_{V} \Sigma + \int_{V} F_b = \int_{V^+} \Sigma 
                                   - \int_{z=0} \tau_b \cdot \mathbf{u}_b\,dx dy \f]
because of the delta function in the expression for \f$F_b\f$.  Let
  \f[ \bar \Sigma = (\epsilon A)^{-1} \int_{V^+} \Sigma, \f]
  \f[ \bar F = - A^{-1} \int_{z=0} \tau_b \cdot \mathbf{u}_b\,dx dy.  \f]
These quantities will be addressed later.

As with core BOMBPROOF we will treat horizontal and vertical advection by different schemes.
We split the integral
  \f[ \int_{V^+} \mathbf{U} \cdot \nabla E
      = \int_{V^+} \left(u \frac{\partial E}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial E}{\partial y}\right)
       + \int_{V^+} w \frac{\partial E}{\partial z}.  \f] 
Let
  \f[ I = (\epsilon A)^{-1} \int_{V^+} \left( u \frac{\partial E}{\partial x} 
                                             + v \frac{\partial E}{\partial y}\right). \f]

Ignore the temperate ice case, for the moment, so
  \f[ \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{z} = \begin{cases}
                                      - k_i c_i^{-1} \frac{\partial E}{\partial z}, & z>0, \\
                                      - k_b c_b^{-1} \frac{\partial E}{\partial z}, & z<0.
                                    \end{cases} \f]

Combining the above fragments by substitution into (\ref interface1), here is the 
equation from which we will produce a finite
difference equation corresponding to the \f$z=0\f$ grid point in a vertical column of ice:
\anchor interface2
  \f[ \rho_i \int_{V^+} \frac{\partial E}{\partial t}
         + \rho_b \int_{V^-} \frac{\partial E}{\partial t}
        = k_i c_i^{-1} \int_{S^+} \frac{\partial E}{\partial z}
          - k_b c_b^{-1} \int_{S^-} \frac{\partial E}{\partial z}
          - \rho_i \int_{V^+} w \frac{\partial E}{\partial z}
          - \rho_i \epsilon A I + \epsilon A \bar \Sigma + A \bar F. \tag{interface2}\f]

Let \f$E_{0^+}^n\f$ be the value of the enthalpy in the ice
at the grid point at \f$z=0\f$.  Let \f$E_{0^-}^n\f$ be the value of the enthalpy 
in the bedrock at the grid point at \f$z=0\f$.  These are not generally the same value; 
we will allow a jump at \f$z=0\f$ in the enthalpy, even as we enforce continuity of temperature
at that location.

The scheme will be implicit (backward Euler).  We use the same notation as in describing 
core BOMBPROOF.  For the left side of the equation, we approximate
\f$E\f$ in \f$V^\pm\f$ by its value at \f$z=0\f$, respectively, making a \f$O(\Delta z)\f$
error right away.  The integrals \f$I\f$, \f$\bar \Sigma\f$, and \f$\bar F\f$ are
evaluated explicitly, at time \f$t_n\f$.  From (\ref interface2),
  \f[ \rho_i \epsilon A \frac{E_{0^+}^{n+1} - E_{0^+}^n}{\Delta t}
         + \rho_b \epsilon A \frac{E_{0^-}^{n+1} - E_{0^-}^n}{\Delta t}
        = k_i c_i^{-1} A \frac{E_{+1}^{n+1} - E_{0^+}^{n+1}}{2\epsilon}
          - k_b c_b^{-1} A \frac{E_{0^-}^{n+1} - E_{-1}^{n+1}}{2\epsilon}
          - \rho_i \epsilon A w_0^n \frac{ \Up{w_0^n}{ E_\bullet^{n+1} } }{2\epsilon}
          - \rho_i \epsilon A I^n + \epsilon A \bar \Sigma^n + A \bar F^n. \f]
Divide by \f$\epsilon A = \Delta z A / 2\f$:
  \f[ \rho_i \frac{E_{0^+}^{n+1} - E_{0^+}^n}{\Delta t}
         + \rho_b \frac{E_{0^-}^{n+1} - E_{0^-}^n}{\Delta t}
        = 2 k_i c_i^{-1} \frac{E_{+1}^{n+1} - E_{0^+}^{n+1}}{\Delta z^2}
          - 2 k_b c_b^{-1} \frac{E_{0^-}^{n+1} - E_{-1}^{n+1}}{\Delta z^2}
          - \rho_i w_0^n \frac{ \Up{w_0^n}{ E_\bullet^{n+1} } }{\Delta z}
          - \rho_i I^n + \bar \Sigma^n + \frac{2 \bar F}{\Delta z}. \f]
Define
  \f[ \hat\rho = \frac{\rho_i}{\rho_b}, \qquad 
      R_i = \frac{k_i \Delta t}{c_i \rho_i \Delta z^2}, \qquad
      R_b = \frac{k_b \Delta t}{c_b \rho_b \Delta z^2}, \qquad
      \nu = \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta z}.  \f]
Multiply both sides of our evolving equation by \f$\Delta t/\rho_b\f$ to get:
\anchor scaledinter
\f{align*}
 \hat\rho &(E_{0^+}^{n+1} - E_{0^+}^n) + (E_{0^-}^{n+1} - E_{0^-}^n) \\
         &= \hat\rho 2 R_i (E_{+1}^{n+1} - E_{0^+}^{n+1})
                           - 2 R_b (E_{0^-}^{n+1} - E_{-1}^{n+1})
          - \hat\rho \nu w_0^n \Up{w_0^n}{ E_\bullet^{n+1} }
          - \Delta t \hat\rho I^n 
          + \frac{\Delta t \bar \Sigma^n}{\rho_b}
          + \frac{2 \nu \bar F^n}{\rho_b}.  \tag{scaledinter}
\f}

Because there is asymmetry of flow, with nonzero vertical velocity only
in the ice and not in the bedrock, we must interpret the vertical advection
upwind term carefully.  We choose to include vertical advection, by upwinding,
<i>only in the case of a downward vertical velocity</i>.
We approximate the entire vertical advection term by zero
in the upward velocity case.  (Downward vertical velocity corresponds 
to a positive basal melt rate.)  In terms of \f$\uppair{a}{b}\f$ notation, we choose
  \f[ \Up{w_0^n}{ E_\bullet^{n+1} } = \uppair{0}{E_{+1}^{n+1} - E_{0^+}^{n+1}}. \f]
The second case is when \f$w_0^n < 0\f$.

Regarding the horizontal advection term \f$I^n\f$, its discrete approximation is this:
  \f[ I^n = u_{ij0}^n\,\frac{\Up{E_{\bullet j0}^n}{u_{ij0}^n}}{\Delta x}
	                          + v_{ij0}^n\,\frac{\Up{E_{i\bullet 0}^n}{v_{ij0}^n}}{\Delta y}.  \f]
Here the \f$i,j\f$ indices re-appear for (hoped) clarity.  And \f$E_{ij0}^n = E_{0^+}^n\f$
is a known variable in our context, etc.

Equation (\ref scaledinter) is one of a system of equations for the new values.
Thus we re-arrange it with the unknowns on the left, as with core BOMBPROOF:
\anchor nearlythere
\f{align*}
- 2 R_b E_{-1}^{n+1} &+ (1 + 2 R_b) E_{0^-}^{n+1}
      + \hat\rho \left(1 + 2 R_i - \nu w_0^n \uppair{0}{1}\right) E_{0^+}^{n+1}
      + \hat\rho \left(-2 R_i + \nu w_0^n \uppair{0}{1}\right) E_{+1}^{n+1} \tag{nearlythere} \\
     &= \hat\rho E_{0^+}^{n} + E_{0^-}^{n} - \Delta t \hat\rho I^n
       + \frac{\Delta t \bar \Sigma^n}{\rho_b}
       + \frac{2 \nu \bar F^n}{\rho_b}. 
\f}

We decide, somewhat arbitrarily, that we will use the known value of the ice basal enthalpy
as the value \f$E_{0^+}^{n}\f$.  Then there are actually five unknowns in the equation,
four on the left and one on the right,
  \f[ E_{-1}^{n+1}, \quad E_{0^-}^{n+1}, \quad E_{0^+}^{n+1}, \quad E_{+1}^{n+1}, \quad
      \text{and} \quad E_{0^-}^n. \f]
But we need to have an equation which can be part of a tridiagonal system, with three unknowns.
<i>Therefore we need two additional pieces of information relating these five unknowns.</i>

Those pieces are the continuity of temperature at \f$z=0\f$ at time \f$t_n\f$ 
\e and at time \f$t_{n+1}\f$.  Note that the pressure at that location is known in this context
(\f$p=\rho_i g H_{i,j}^n\f$, by the hydrostatic approximation).  The two additional equations are
\f{align*}
  T_b(E_{0^-}^n,p) &= T_i(E_{0^+}^n,p), \\
  T_b(E_{0^-}^{n+1},p) &= T_i(E_{0^+}^{n+1},p).
\f}
The functions \f$T_b()\f$ and \f$T_i()\f$ are exactly EnthalpyConverter::getAbsTempBedrock() and
EnthalpyConverter::getAbsTemp(), respectively.

In fact it gets even simpler.  We invert the functions \f$T_b()\f$ on the left side of the
above temperature continuity equations, and we insert these expressions into (\ref nearlythere) to get
\anchor evencloser
\f{align*}
- 2 R_b E_{-1}^{n+1} &+ (1 + 2 R_b) E_b(T_i(E_{0^+}^{n+1},p),p)
      + \hat\rho \left(1 + 2 R_i - \nu w_0^n \uppair{0}{1}\right) E_{0^+}^{n+1}
      + \hat\rho \left(-2 R_i + \nu w_0^n \uppair{0}{1}\right) E_{+1}^{n+1} \tag{evencloser}\\
     &= \hat\rho E_{0^+}^{n} + E_b(T_i(E_{0^+}^n,p),p) - \Delta t \hat\rho I^n
      + \frac{\Delta t \bar \Sigma^n}{\rho_b} + \frac{2 \nu \bar F^n}{\rho_b}. 
\f}
The function \f$E_b()\f$ is exactly EnthalpyConverter::getEnthBedrock() (which actually takes 
no pressure variable because of how enthalpy is normalized).  This equation has only
the three unknowns \f$E_{-1}^{n+1}\f$, \f$E_{0^+}^{n+1}\f$, and \f$E_{+1}^{n+1}\f$.  It is,
essentially, ready to be inserted into the tridiagonal system of equations managed 
by an enthSystemCtx instance.

Now, for the current enthalpy normalization in EnthalpyConverter, 
  \f[ E_b(T,p) = c_b T \qquad \text{and} \qquad
      T_i(E,p) = \begin{cases} \frac{E}{c_i},               & E \le E_s(p), \\
                               T_m(p) = \frac{E_s(p)}{c_i}, & E>E_s(p).\end{cases} \f]
Thus 
  \f[ E_b(T_i(E,p),p) = \begin{cases} \frac{c_b}{c_i} E, & E\le E_s(p), \\
                                      \frac{c_b}{c_i} E_s(p), &        E>E_s(p).\end{cases} \f]
This means we can simplify equation (\ref evencloser).

In fact, here is the 
final form of our ice-bedrock interface finite difference equation,
for insertion into the tridiagonal system managed by enthSystemCtx::solveThisColumn(),
in the case that \f$E_{0+}^n \le E_s(p)\f$:
\anchor icebedfinalcold
\f{align*}
- 2 R_b E_{-1}^{n+1} &+ \left[(1 + 2 R_b) \frac{c_b}{c_i} 
      + \hat\rho \left(1 + 2 R_i - \nu w_0^n \uppair{0}{1}\right) \right] E_{0^+}^{n+1}
      + \hat\rho \left(-2 R_i + \nu w_0^n \uppair{0}{1}\right) E_{+1}^{n+1} \tag{icebedfinalcold} \\
   &= \left(\hat\rho + \frac{c_b}{c_i} \right) E_{0^+}^n 
      - \Delta t \hat\rho I^n 
      + \frac{\Delta t \bar \Sigma^n}{\rho_b} + \frac{2 \nu \bar F^n}{\rho_b}. 
\f}
When this equation is used, it is possible that the computed quantity \f$E_{0+}^{n+1}\f$ 
exceeds \f$E_s(p)\f$ even though \f$E_{0+}^n \le E_s(p)\f$ at the start of the timestep.
We do not iterate or alter the equation in this case, but accept the (presumably small) error.

If \f$E_{0+}^n > E_s(p)\f$ then we assume that \f$E_{0+}^{n+1} > E_s(p)\f$ will hold as 
well, and therefore we compute the two terms which come from temperature continuity differently:
\anchor icebedfinaltemperate
\f{align*}
- 2 R_b E_{-1}^{n+1} &+ \hat\rho \left(1 + 2 R_i - \nu w_0^n \uppair{0}{1}\right) E_{0^+}^{n+1}
      + \hat\rho \left(-2 R_i + \nu w_0^n \uppair{0}{1}\right) E_{+1}^{n+1} \tag{icebedfinaltemperate}\\
   &= \hat\rho E_{0^+}^n - 2 R_b \frac{c_b}{c_i} E_s(p)
      - \Delta t \hat\rho I^n 
      + \frac{\Delta t \bar \Sigma^n}{\rho_b} + \frac{2 \nu \bar F^n}{\rho_b}. 
\f}
Again a small error results if \f$E_{0+}^n > E_s(p)\f$ while for the computed quantity
at the next time, \f$E_{0+}^{n+1} < E_s(p)\f$; we accept it.

Equations (\ref icebedfinal_cold) and (\ref icebedfinal_temperate) are only
used in PISM if there is a positive bedrock thermal layer
depth, which is the condition IceGrid::Mbz > 1 or, equivalently, IceGrid::Lbz > 0.0.

Note that within the code IceEnthalpyModel::enthalpyAndDrainageStep() and
enthSystemCtx::solveThisColumn(), the \f$z=0\f$ level has \c k=k0 so the levels denoted
with subscripts \f$+1,0,-1\f$ above are actually at <tt>k=k0+1,k0,k0-1</tt>, respectively.


\section otherice Other concerns: for the lowest ice column segment

If there is no bedrock, which is a valid modeling choice and which a PISM user
may make, then the above argument does not apply to the basal ice segment.  Therefore
reconsider \ref figure1 "Figure 1", which has volume \f$V\f$ surrounded by a dotted line,
without the bedrock part of the column.  We will integrate our conservation of energy equation
  \f[ \rho \frac{dE}{dt} = -\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} + Q \f]
\e over \f$V^+\f$ \e only, that is, only over the upper half of \f$V\f$.  Volume \f$V^+\f$
is between levels \f$z=0\f$ and \f$z=+\epsilon=\Delta z/2\f$.  The upper surface of
\f$V^+\f$ is \f$S^+\f$.  Denote the \f$z=0\f$ lower surface of \f$V^+\f$ by 
\f$S^0\f$.

Doing this integral and ignoring side conduction (by shallowness) gives
  \f[ \rho_i \int_{V^+} \frac{\partial E}{\partial t}
         + \rho_i \int_{V^+} \mathbf{U} \cdot \nabla E
        = - \int_{S^+} \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{z}
          - \int_{S^0} \mathbf{q} \cdot (-\mathbf{z}) + \int_V \Sigma.\f]
Compare to equation (\ref interface1).

On surface \f$S^+\f$,
  \f[ \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{z} = - k_i c_i^{-1} \frac{\partial E}{\partial z}. \f]
On surface \f$S^0\f$,
  \f[ \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{z} = G + \frac{1}{2} (-\tau_b \cdot \mathbf{u}_b). \f]
That is, on surface \f$S^0\f$ we assume half of the positive frictional heating flux
\f$-\tau_b \cdot \mathbf{u}_b\f$, which has SI units W m-2 = J s-1 m-2, enters the ice,
along with the geothermal flux which is applied here at the base of the ice, instead
of under the bedrock.

Doing the same approximations as before, with the same meaning for symbols
\f$A,I^n,\bar\Sigma,\bar F\f$, and upwinding notation, as before, gives
  \f[ \rho_i \epsilon A \frac{E_{0}^{n+1} - E_{0}^n}{\Delta t} + \rho_i \epsilon A I^n
           + \rho_i \epsilon A w_0^n \frac{ \Up{w_0^n}{ E_\bullet^{n+1} } }{2\epsilon}
      = k_i c_i^{-1} A \frac{E_{+1}^{n+1} - E_{0}^{n+1}}{2\epsilon}
           + A (G + 0.5 \bar F^n) + \epsilon A \bar \Sigma^n. \f]
Dividing by \f$\epsilon A\f$ and multiplying by \f$\Delta t (\rho_i)^{-1}\f$,
as before, gives:
  \f[ E_{0}^{n+1} - E_{0}^n + \Delta t I^n + \nu w_0^n \Up{w_0^n}{ E_\bullet^{n+1} }
      = 2 R_i \left(E_{+1}^{n+1} - E_{0}^{n+1} \right)
           + \frac{2 \nu}{\rho_i} (G + 0.5 \bar F^n) + \frac{\Delta t}{\rho_i} \bar \Sigma^n. \f]
Recall
  \f[ \Up{w_0^n}{ E_\bullet^{n+1} } = \uppair{0}{E_{+1}^{n+1} - E_{0^+}^{n+1}}. \f]
Using this, and rearranging with unknowns (superscript \f$n+1\f$) on the left, we get 
\anchor icebasenobedrock
  \f[ \left(1 + 2 R_i - \nu w_0^n \uppair{0}{1}\right) E_{0}^{n+1}
        + \left(-2 R_i + \nu w_0^n \uppair{0}{1}\right) E_{+1}^{n+1} 
      = E_{0}^n - \Delta t I^n  + \frac{2 \nu}{\rho_i} (G + 0.5 \bar F^n)
        + \frac{\Delta t}{\rho_i} \bar \Sigma^n. \tag{icebasenobedrock}\f]
This is the equation used in the tridiagonal system managed by
enthSystemCtx::solveThisColumn(), in the case of the ice basal segment if there
is no bedrock thermal layer.  (Note there is no distinction here between
cold and temperate cases, which is generally
the case for the enthalpy method, except when we ask for temperature continuity
when the ice meets bedrock, the case above.)


\section otherbedrock Other concerns: for the highest bedrock column segment

Recall that we have already described the numerical scheme for the conservation of energy 
in bedrock, above.  The equation
  \f[ \rho_b \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} = k_b c_b^{-1}  \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial z^2}, \f]
had a finite difference approximation, in the tridiagonal system,
  \f[ -R_b E_{k-1}^{n+1} + \left(1 + 2 R_b\right) E_k^{n+1} - R_b E_{k+1}^{n+1}
         = E_k^n. \f]
Consider the \f$k=-1\f$ case (more properly, the <tt>k=k0-1</tt> case in 
enthSystemCtx::solveThisColumn()).  In this case the
level above, \f$k=0\f$, is where our equation couples to the unknown
ice/base transition value \f$E_{0^-}^{n+1}\f$.  This is an enthalpy
in bedrock, which is different from the ice enthalpy value \f$E_{0^+}^{n+1}\f$.

We need to use the correct enthalpy at the \f$k=0\f$ level.  Again we do this by enforcing
continuity of temperature, which is only necessary at the \f$n+1\f$ time:
  \f[  T_b(E_{0^-}^{n+1},p) = T_i(E_{0^+}^{n+1},p). \f]
This continuity requirement implies, with choices in EnthalpyConverter,
  \f[ E_{0^-}^{n+1} = \frac{c_b}{c_i} E_{0^+}^{n+1}. \f]
The result is a revised equation
\anchor neartopofbedrock
  \f[ -R_b E_{-2}^{n+1} + \left(1 + 2 R_b\right) E_{-1}^{n+1} - R_b \frac{c_b}{c_i} E_{0^+}^{n+1}
         = E_{-1}^n. \tag{neartopofbedrock} \f]
This equation is used in the tridiagonal system managed by enthSystemCtx::solveThisColumn().


\section morebedrock Other concerns, continued: effect of temperate ice and frictional heating on bedrock temps

Recall that the frictional heating rate, from sliding, contributes to the
conservation of energy equation in the ice/bedrock transition segment.  (See equation
(\ref interface1) and the definition of \f$\bar F\f$ following it.)  Though we believe
that the scheme, as described above, is reasonable, its discrete time implementation can
generate unreasonable temperature profiles in the bedrock.  In particular, continuity
of temperature at the ice/bedrock interface is enforced at the end of the step:
  \f[T_b(E_{0^-}^{n+1},p) = T_i(E_{0^+}^{n+1},p).\f]
