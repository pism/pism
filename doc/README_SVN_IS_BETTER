O.k.  So a gzipped tarball is kind of comforting to you.  Here is one
last effort to suggest Subversion (svn).   If you checkout the stable
release with svn, a la
  
  svn co http://svn.gna.org/svn/pism/tags/stable0.3 pism0.3

or similar then you can get bug fixes by just doing

  svn up

If you use the .tar.gz then you have to create a new directory 
and think about all the clutter you have already created, and
whether you want to save it.
