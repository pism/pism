\section{Installation}\label{sect:install}

\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\textbf{\arabic{enumi}.}~}
\begin{enumerate}
\item You will need a UNIX system with internet access.  A GNU/Linux environment will be easiest but other UNIX versions have been used successfully.  Package management systems are useful for installing many of the tools below, \emph{but} neither PISM itself nor up-to-date PETSc distributions are currently available in the Debian repositories.  You will need Python (\url{http://www.python.org/}) and Subversion (\url{http://subversion.tigris.org/}) installed, but these are included in all current Linux distributions.

\item To use the graphical output of PISM, which we recommend, you will need an X Windows server \emph{and} the developers' version of X11, which will contain the needed header files.  The relevant development package in Debian is called \verb|xorg-dev|.

\item PISM uses NetCDF (= \emph{network Common Data Form}; \url{http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/}) for an input and output file format.   Install it using the instructions at the NetCDF webpage or using a package management system.  You will need the development version (package) which includes the header files; this is the \verb|netcdfg-dev| package in the Debian repositories.

\item PISM uses the GSL (= \emph{GNU Scientific Library}; \url{http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/}) for certain numerical calculations and special functions.  Install it using the instructions at the GSL webpage or using a package management system.  You will need the development version (package) which includes header files; this is the \verb|libgsl0-dev| package in the Debian repositories.

\item PISM optionally uses the ``FFTW'' library (FFTW = \emph{Fastest Fourier Transform in the West}; \url{http://www.fftw.org/}) in approximating the deformation of the solid earth under ice loads \cite{BLKfastearth}.  If you want the functionality of this earth model, which is coupled to the ice flow and which we recommend, install FFTW or check that it is installed already.   In particular, get the development version with header files, which is \verb|fftw3-dev| in Debian.   If FFTW is \emph{not installed}, however, turn off PISM's attempt to build with it by setting the environment variable \verb|WITH_FFTW=0|.   If this library is absent, all of PISM will work \emph{except} for the bed deformation model described in the paper \cite{BLKfastearth}.

\item You will need a version of MPI (= \emph{Message Passing Interface}; \url{http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/}).  Your system may have an existing MPI installation in which case the path to the MPI directory will be used when installing PETSc below.  Otherwise we recommend that you allow PETSc to download MPICH2 (\url{http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich2/}) as part of the PETSc configure process (next).  In either case, once MPI is installed, you will want to add the MPI \verb|bin| directory to your path so that you can invoke MPI using the \verb|mpiexec| or \verb|mpirun| command.  For example, you can add it with the statement

\verb|export PATH=/home/user/mympi/bin:$PATH|  \qquad (for \verb|bash| shell)

\noindent or

\verb|setenv PATH /home/user/mympi/bin:$PATH|  \qquad (for \verb|csh| or \verb|tcsh| shell).

\noindent Such a statement can, of course, appear in your \verb|.bashrc|, \verb|.profile|, or \verb|.cshrc| file so that there is no need to retype it each time you use MPI.

\medskip
\centerline{\emph{From now on this manual will assume use of} bash.}
\medskip

\item PISM uses PETSc (= \emph{Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific computation}; \url{http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-2/index.html}).  As mentions of this library will occur frequently in this manual, note ``PETSc'' is pronounced ``pet-see''.  Download the PETSc source by grabbing the current gzipped tarball at \url{http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-as/download/index.html}.  PISM requires a version of PETSc which is \texttt{\PETSCREV} or later.   The ``lite'' form of PETSc is fine if you are willing to depend on an internet connection for accessing the PETSc documentation. 

You should configure and build PETSc \emph{essentially} as described on the installation page \url{http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-2/documentation/installation.html}, but it might be best to read the following comments on the PETSc configure and build process first:

\renewcommand{\labelenumii}{(\roman{enumii})}\begin{enumerate}
\item Untar in your preferred location, but note PETSc should \emph{not} be configured (next) using root privileges.  Note that you will need to define the environment variable \verb|PETSC_DIR| before configuring PETSc (next).  For instance, once you have entered the PETSc directory just untarred, \verb|export PETSC_DIR=|$\phantom{!}^\backprime \mathtt{pwd}^\backprime$.  (Note the use of the backprime (\emph{accent-grave}) character, and not the single apostrophe \verb|'|.)

\item When you run the configure script in the PETSc directory, the following options are recommended; note PISM uses shared libraries by default:

\verb|$  ./config/configure.py --with-shared --with-c-support --with-clanguage=cxx|

Note that there is no PISM use of Fortran, and that it is sometimes convenient to have PETSc grab a local copy of BLAS and LAPACK rather than using the system-wide version.  So one may add ``\verb|--with-fortran=0| \verb|--download-c-blas-lapack=1|'' to the other configure options.

\item If there is an existing MPI installation, for example at \verb|/home/user/mympi/|, one can point PETSc to it by adding the option \verb|--with-mpi-dir=/home/user/mympi/|.  The path used in this option must have MPI executables \verb|mpicxx| and \verb|mpicc|, and either \verb|mpiexec| or \verb|mpirun|, in subdirectory \verb|bin/| and MPI library files in subdirectory \verb|lib/|.

\item On the other hand, it seems common that one needs to tell PETSc to download MPI into a place it understands, even if there is an existing MPI.  If you get messages suggesting that PETSc cannot configure using your existing MPI, you might try \verb|configure.py| with option \verb|--download-mpich=1|.

\item Configuration of PETSc for a batch system requires special procedures described at the PETSc documentation site.  One starts with a configure option \verb|--with-batch=1|.  See the ``Installing on machine requiring cross compiler or a job scheduler'' section of the installation page \url{http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-as/documentation/installation.html}.

\item  Configuring PETSc takes many minutes even when everything goes smoothly.   A value for the environment variable \verb|PETSC_ARCH| will be reported at the end of the configure process; take note of this value.  (Note that a previously installed PETSc can be reconfigured with a new \verb|PETSC_ARCH| if necessary.)

\item  After \verb|configure.py| finishes, you will need to \verb|make all test| in the PETSc directory and watch the result.  If the X Windows system is functional some example viewers will appear; as noted you will need the X header files for this to work.

\item Finally, you will want to set the \verb|PETSC_DIR| and the \verb|PETSC_ARCH| environment variables in your \verb|.profile| or \verb|.bashrc| file.  Also remember to add the MPI \verb|bin| directory to your \verb|PATH|.  For instance, if you used the option \verb|--download-mpich=1| in the PETSc configure, the MPI \verb|bin| directory will have a path like \verb|$PETSC_DIR/| \verb|externalpackages/mpich2-1.0.4p1/$PETSC_ARCH/bin/|.  Therefore the lines 

\small
\verb|export PETSC_DIR=/home/user/petsc-2.3.3-p2/|

\verb|export PETSC_ARCH=linux-gnu-c-debug|

\verb|export PATH=$PETSC_DIR/externalpackages/mpich2-1.0.4p1/$PETSC_ARCH/bin/:$PATH|
\normalsize

\noindent could appear in one of those files.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip
See Table \ref{tab:PISMdepends} for a summary of the dependencies on external libraries, including those mentioned so far.

\medskip
At this point you have configured the environment which PISM needs.  You are ready to build PISM itself, which is a much quicker procedure!
\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}\setcounter{enumi}{5}
\item \label{getPISMstep} Get the latest source for PISM by

\verb|svn co http://svn.gna.org/svn/pism/trunk pism|

\noindent A directory called ``\verb|pism/|'' will be created.  (Note that in the future when you enter that directory, \verb|svn update| will update to the latest revision of PISM.  After \verb|svn update| you will \verb|make| and \verb|make install| to rebuild PISM with the newest sources.)

\item Build PISM:

\verb|cd pism|

\verb|make|

\verb|make install|

\noindent  Note that the ``\verb|make install|'' puts executables, including \verb|pismv|, and \verb|pisms|, in the \verb|pism/bin/| subdirectory and cleans up the junk from the build process.  ``\verb|make install|'' does \emph{not} require root permission.  (Please report any problems you meet at this stage by sending us the output: \verb|ffelb@uaf.edu|.)

\item PISM executables can be run most easily by adding the directories \verb|pism/bin/| and \verb|pism/test/| to your \verb|PATH|.  The former directory contains the major PISM executables while the latter contains several useful scripts.  For instance, this command can be done in the \verb|bash| shell or in your \verb|.bashrc| file:

\verb|export PATH=/home/user/pism/bin/:/home/user/pism/test/:$PATH|
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip
You are done with installation at this point.  The next few items are recommended as they allow you to observe that PISM is functioning correctly.
\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}\setcounter{enumi}{9}
\item \label{serialpismvrun} Try a serial verification run of PISM:

\verb|pismv -test G -y 100|

\noindent If you see some output and a final \verb|Writing model state| \verb|to file 'verify.nc'| \verb|... done| then PISM completed successfully.  Note that at the end of this run you get measurements of the difference between the numerical result and the exact solution \cite{BBL}.

\item Try the MPI four processor version of the above run:

\verb|mpiexec -n 4 pismv -test G -y 100|

\noindent This should work even if there is only one actual processor on your machine, in which case MPI will run multiple processes on the one processor, naturally.  The reported errors should be very nearly the same as the serial run above, but the results should appear faster (if there really are four processors)!

\item Try a verification run on a finer vertical grid while watching the diagnostic views which use Xwindows:

\verb|pismv -test G -Mz 201 -y 2000 -d HTc|

\noindent When using such diagnostic views and \verb|mpiexec| the additional final option \verb|-display :0| is sometimes required to enable MPI to use Xwindows:

\verb|mpiexec -n 2 pismv -test G -Mz 201 -y 2000 -d HTc -display :0|

\item Run a verification test of the ice stream code:

\verb|pismv -test I -Mx 5 -My 401 -verbose|

\noindent This runs a rather different part of the PISM code and then compares the numerical result to the exact solution appearing in \cite{SchoofStream}.

\item Run a Python script for a basic suite of verifications:

\verb|verifynow.py|

\noindent If you would like us to confirm that PISM is working as expected please save the one page or so of output from this script and send it to us (\verb|ffelb@uaf.edu|).  See section \ref{sect:verif} for more on PISM verification.
\end{enumerate}
\bigskip

Have fun!

At this stage you can do the EISMINT II simplified geometry experiments and run some verification tests without further downloads.  Section \ref{sect:real} gives examples of using PISM to model a real ice sheet and a real ice shelf using freely-downloadable data.

Naturally, setting up PISM to model real ice sheets will generally require techniques not be covered in this manual.  It may require the writing of additional source code, which for PISM means writing a derived class of the base \verb|IceModel| class.  (Note PISM is written in C++.  The base class is defined in the source file \verb|pism/src/iceModel.hh|.)  Use of PISM for real ice sheet modelling is something we welcome questions about, and will attempt to help with, but we will not pretend it is routine.

A final reminder with respect to installation:  Once you have checked out a copy of PISM using Subversion, as in step \ref{getPISMstep} above, you can update it to the latest version by \verb|svn update| in the \verb|pism/| directory, after which you will want to \verb|make| and \verb|make install| in order to rebuild the PISM executables using the updated source files.

\section{Getting started}\label{sect:start}

\subsection{Running the EISMINT II tests}  PISM's purpose is the realistic simulation of ice sheets.  But real ice sheet simulations require real data.  Real ice sheet and ice shelf data are available on the web as part of the EISMINT intercomparison efforts.  Section \ref{sect:real} is a tutorial on the use of PISM as a Greenland ice sheet or Ross ice shelf flow model using the EISMINT data sets.

For now, however, and to avoid issues of data formats (and data flaws) in a first use of PISM, this section describes how to use PISM for experiment F in the EISMINT II thermomechanical coupling intercomparison \cite{EISMINT00}.  In this experiment one tries to approximate an unstable equilibrium of the thermomechanically coupled differential equations for a shallow, grounded ice sheet, and one inevitably gets ``spokes'' in the basal temperature field \cite{BBL,PayneBaldwin}.  

In EISMINT II the prescribed grid has 60 subintervals in each direction, with each subinterval of length 25km, for a total width of 1500 km for the computational box in both $x$ and $y$ directions, but the vertical grid is not prescribed.  However, PISM always allows choice of the grid in all three dimensions.  A runtime option chooses the number of grid points in each direction.  (Note that the number of points is one greater than the number of subintervals or grid spaces.)  We choose the standard 25km grid in the horizontal and use 201 grid points in the vertical for a 25 m (equally-spaced) grid.  Note that the computational box is 5000 m high by default for EISMINT II experiment F in PISM.  

In EISMINT II all runs are for 200,000 model years, but we start with a short 2000 year run for a quicker illustration.  The executable is ``\t{pisms}'', a name which has trailing ``\t{s}'' for the ``simplifed geometry mode'' of PISM:

\small\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}

done with run ... Writing model state to file `simp_exper.nc' ... done.
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}\normalsize
\noindent This should have taken less than 30 seconds on any modern computer.  

In a moment we will address the standard output information provided by PISM, as shown above, but for now we simply illustrate how to restart and complete the 200,000 year run.  We see that the model state was stored in a NetCDF file with the \verb|pisms| default name ``\texttt{simp\underline{ }exper.nc}''.  We will see next an example which uses a ``\verb|-o|'' option to name the output file.  Also, the above was a single processor run, but let's suppose we have a four processor machine.  (In fact, the following should also work as stated on a single processor machine under most MPI installations.)  Let's run things in the background so we can continue to experiment:

\small\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}
$  mpiexec -n 4 pisms -eisII F -if simp_exper.nc -y 198000 \
  -o eisIIF200k >> eisIIF.out &
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}\normalsize

This run will take at least an hour on a four processor computer.  The file \verb|eisIIF200k.nc| (NetCDF format) will appear at the end.  One can, however, view the redirected standard output by \verb|less eisIIF.out| as the job is running in the background.  Also note that ``\t{top}'' is a convenient tool to see processor usage during the run.

If a view of the model state is desired in the midst of this run, one can send all four running \verb|pisms| processes a signal which causes PISM to write out the model state, namely a file in NetCDF format with name \verb|pism-|\emph{year}\verb|.nc| at that instant: \verb|pkill -USR1 pisms|.  On the other hand, if one terminates the run with \verb|pkill pism| then the run will stop with the model state saved in the named output file \verb|eisIIF200k.nc| even though it will not represent the state at 200,000 years.  (See subsection \ref{subsect:signal} on how PISM catches signals.)

While the four process run continues in the background, let's view the model state during a few time steps by starting from the saved 2000 year state.  We use PISM's ``diagnostic viewers'', which are PETSc viewers under Xwindows:

\small\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}

Three figures should appear and be refreshed at each time step.  One figure is a map-plane view of thickness, another is a map-plane view of the basal temperature in Kelvin, and third there is a graph of height above the bed versus temperature.  

When the full 200,000 year run finishes, on can display the result by \verb|pisms -eisII F| \verb|-if eisIIF200k.nc -y 200 -d HTt|.  In that case a result like that shown in figure \ref{fig:screenshot} will appear.

\end{figure}

At each time step PISM shows a summary of the model state using a few numbers.  The format of the summary is

\small\verb|$$$$$      YEAR (+    STEP[N$]):     VOL    AREA    MELTF     THICK0     TEMP0|\normalsize

\noindent The first five columns are flags telling the user which quantities are being updated at that time step.  A dollar sign appears if the quantity does not update.  From the left the positions are: [\t{b\$}] for bed elevation, [\t{vV\$}] for velocity, [\t{g\$}] for grain size, [\t{t\$}] for temperature and age (which are always updated together), and [\t{f\$}] for surface elevation.   (That is, an ``\verb|f|'' in the last column means a step of the flow or mass conservation equation has occurred.  Regarding the two possible velocity flags, a lower case ``\texttt{v}'' indicates that the 3D velocity field has been updated, e.g.~as needed for the advection of temperature, while uppercase ``\texttt{V}'' indicates that only the vertically-averaged velocity, and the associated diffusivity, has been updated.)

The time (``\t{YEAR}'') and time step (``\t{STEP}'') are in years.  In the above examples the time step is 60 years because that is the default maximum time step.  A small whole number and a single character flag appear in square brackets after the time step, and these explain what part of the adaptive time-stepping scheme was used to determine the time step.  For instance, ``\t{m}'' means that the step was the maximum allowed, ``\t{e}'' means that the time step was shortened to hit the end of the specified run, ``\t{d}'' means the step was determined by the diffusivity of the flow equation \cite{BBL}, and ``\t{c}'' means the CFL condition limited the time step \cite{BBL,MortonMayers}.  The small integer before this single character flag is related to the \verb|-tempskip| mechanism; see sections \ref{sect:options} and \ref{sect:simp} for further description and examples of this mechanism.

The next three columns in the summary report the volume of the ice in $10^6 \,\text{km}^3$, the area covered by the ice in $10^6\,\text{km}^2$, and the basal melt fraction, that is, the fraction of the ice area where the basal homologous temperature is above $273.0$ (i.e.~slightly lower than the triple point).  The next two columns ``\texttt{THICK0}'' and ``\texttt{TEMP0}'' are values at the center of the computational domain of the map plane, namely the thickness in meters and the basal absolute temperature in Kelvin.  These five numbers are also the ones reported in the tables in \cite{EISMINT00}, which is sometime useful for comparison.  (This summary of the model state can be made more verbose by using the option \verb|-verbose|.  For more on the EISMINT II experiments see section \ref{sect:simp}.)

\subsection{Visualizing the results}  There are two basic modes for visualizing the various quantities in PISM, namely using runtime viewers and visualizing the final NetCDF file.

At runtime, various diagnostic viewers can be specified by options of the form \verb|-d HTt| or \verb|-dbig HTt|; see Appendix C.  These viewers are updated at each step and work under Xwindows.  The format is limited by the style of PETSc viewers, but these viewers suffice for quick visualization and allow the monitoring of the run.  Note that some diagnostic viewers show slices parallel to the bed.  They are controlled by the option \verb|-kd|.  Those which show ``soundings'' are controlled by the options \verb|-id|, \verb|-jd|; see Appendix A.

When a PISM run is finished, the state of the model is output in NetCDF format.  The name can be specified by the option \verb|-o|, so \verb|-o foo| writes the NetCDF file \verb|foo.nc|.  NetCDF files can be viewed or modified with a variety of tools, some of which are mentioned in table \ref{tab:NetCDFview}.  We find \verb|ncview| to be the fastest routine way to look at PISM output files.

\section{Ice dynamics in PISM}\label{sect:dynamics}

\subsection{Two models of ice flow: slow and fast, but always shallow}  An important fact about PISM is that there are two significantly different sets of equations which determine the velocity field within the ice.  In both cases the geometry of the ice, the basal condition, and the temperature field within the ice determine the flow.  But there are two different versions of the balance of momentum equations:\begin{itemize}
\item the shallow ice approximation (SIA) \cite{Hutter}, describing ice flowing as a function of the driving shear stresses of classical glaciology \cite{Paterson}, and
\item the shallow shelf approximation (SSA) \cite{Morland,MacAyeal,SchoofStream,HumbertGreveHutter,GreveNotes} describing a membrane-type flow driven by longitudinal stress gradients.
\end{itemize}

The SIA equations can confidently be applied to the grounded part of ice sheets for which the basal ice is frozen to the bedrock \cite{Fowler}.  The SSA equations can confidently be applied to ice shelves for which there is no (deviatoric) stress at the base of the (floating) ice \cite{Morland,MorlandZainuddin}.

Ice sheets have faster-flowing grounded parts, however, usually called ``ice streams'' or ``outlet glaciers''.  Describing these faster-flowing grounded parts of ice sheets requires either a higher-order (but still shallow) stress balance \cite{Blatter}, or the Stokes equations which represent the balance of \emph{all} tensor components, \emph{or} one must decide to use SIA in some parts of the grounded ice sheet and SSA in others.  This latter choice is the one made in PISM.

That is, one may apply the SSA equations to grounded ice.  This is justified in the context of the Siple Coast ice streams of Antarctica by MacAyeal \cite{MacAyeal,HulbeMacAyeal} using a linearly-viscous model for the underlying till.  A free boundary problem with essentially the same (SSA) balance equations is the Schoof \cite{SchoofStream} model of ice streams emerging from plastic till failure.  These are the models PISM uses to describe faster-flowing ice, namely either the SSA with linear or plastic till.  In any case, because of the typical magnitudes of the (vertically-integrated horizontal) velocities in these two cases, for the rest of this manual we identify the SIA flow as \emph{slow flow} and all cases of the SSA flow as \emph{fast flow}.

We emphasize that both the SIA and SSA models are \emph{shallow}.  That is, the partial differential equations in these two approximations come by different but analogous small-parameter arguments from the Stokes equations of a non-Newtonian fluid.  (For these small-parameter arguments see \cite{Fowler} and the appendices of \cite{SchoofStream}.)  Of course, the partial differential equations are shallow approximations, but PISM proceeds to only solve them approximately, that is, numerically by finite difference schemes.

The references are, of course, the right place to examine the physics of the continuum equations (approximations) described above.  Here we address how to control which model PISM uses through a \emph{mask}, or, alternatively, how to use a plasticity assumption to determine the region of fast flow through the solution of a free boundary problem.

\section{More on usage}\label{sect:usage}

\subsection{The PISM coordinate system and grid} \label{subsect:coords} PISM does all simulations in a computational box which is rectangular in the PISM coordinates.

The coordinate system has horizontal coordinates $x,y$ and a vertical coordinate $z$.  The $z$ coordinate is measured positive upward from the base of the ice and it is exactly opposite to the vector of gravity.  The surface $z=0$ is the base of the ice, however, and thus is usually not horizontal in the sense of being parallel to the geoid.   The surface $z=0$ is the base of the ice both when the ice is grounded and when the ice is floating.

Bed topography is, of course, allowed.  In fact, when the ice is grounded, the true physical vertical coordinate $z'$, namely the coordinate measure relative to a reference geoid, is given by $z'=z+b(x,y)$ where $b(x,y)$ is the bed topography.  The surface $z'=h(x,y)$ is the surface of the ice.  Thus in the grounded case the equation $h(x,y)=H(x,y)+b(x,y)$ applies if $H(x,y)$ is the thickness of the ice.

In the floating case, the physical vertical coordinate is $z'=z-(\rho_i/\rho_s) H(x,y)$ where $\rho_i$ is the density of ice and $\rho_s$ the density of sea water.  Again $z=0$ is the base of the ice, which is the surface $z' = -(\rho_i/\rho_s) H(x,y)$.  The surface of the ice is $h(x,y) = (1-\rho_i/\rho_s) H(x,y)$.  All we know about the bed elevations is that they are below the base of the ice when the ice is floating.  That is, the \emph{floatation criterion} $-(\rho_i/\rho_s) H(x,y) > b(x,y)$ applies.

The computational box can extend downward into the bedrock.  As $z=0$ is the base of the ice, the bedrock corresponds to negative $z$ values regardless of the sign of its true (i.e.~$z'$) elevation.

The extent of the computational box, along with its bedrock extension downward, is determined by four numbers \t{Lx}, \t{Ly}, \t{Lz}, and \t{Lbz}.  The first two of these are half-widths and have units of kilometers when set by options or displayed.  The last two are vertical distances in the ice and in the bedrock, respectively, and have units of meters.  See the sketch in figure \ref{fig:rectilinearbox}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics[width=4.0in,keepaspectratio=true]{figs/rectilinearbox}
\caption{PISM's computational box.}
\label{fig:rectilinearbox}
\end{figure}

The extent of the computational box for the ice is directly controlled by the options \t{-Lx}, \t{-Ly}, and \t{-Lz} as described in the Runtime options section.  As noted \t{-Lx} and \t{-Ly} options should include values in kilometers while \t{-Lz} should be in meters.

The PISM grid covering the computational box is equally spaced in each of the three dimensions.  Because of the bedrock extension, the grid of points is described by four numbers, namely the number of grid points in the $x$ direction, the number in the $y$ direction, the number in the $z$ direction within the ice, and the number in the $z$ direction within the bedrock.  These are specified by options \verb|-Mx|, \verb|-My|, \verb|-Mz|, and \verb|-Mbz|, respectively, as described in the Runtime options section.  The defaults for these four values are 61, 61, 31, and 1, respectively.  Note that \verb|Mx|, \verb|My|, \verb|Mz|, and \verb|Mbz| all indicate the number of grid \emph{points}.  Therefore the number of grid \emph{spaces} are, respectively, 60, 60, 30, and 0 (zero) in the default case.  Note that the lowest grid point in a column of ice, that is the one at $z=0$, coincides with the highest grid point in the bedrock.  Also \verb|Mbz| must always be at least one.

The distance \t{Lbz} is controlled by specifying the number \verb|Mbz| of grid points in the bedrock, noting that the vertical spacing \t{dz} is the same within the ice and within the bedrock.  To avoid conflicts, the distance \t{Lbz} cannot be set directly by the user.  In particular, $\text{\t{Lbz}}=\text{\t{dz}}\,(\text{\t{Mbz}}-1)$ while $\text{\t{dz}} = \text{\t{Lz}} / (\text{\t{Mz}}-1)$, and so the distance \t{Lbz} into the bedrock is determined by setting \t{Lz}, \t{Mz}, and \t{Mbz}.

One is allowed to specify the grid when PISM is started \emph{without} a pre-existing model state (i.e.~as stored in a NetCDF input file output by PISM).  For instance, a EISMINT II experiment F \cite{EISMINT00} run is

\verb|$  pisms -eisII F -Mx 61 -My 61 -Mz 101 -y 200000 -o foo|

\noindent Note that PISM (i.e.~the executable \verb|pisms|) knows about the size of the computational box appropriate to each of the EISMINT II experiments.

If one initializes PISM from a saved model state then the input model state controls the parameters \t{Mx}, \t{My}, \t{Mz}, and \t{Mbz}.  For instance, the command

\verb|$  pisms -eisII F -if foo.nc -Mz 201 -y 100|

\noindent will give a warning that ``\verb|user option -Mz ignored; value read from file foo.nc|.''  To change the model grid one must explicitly ``regrid'', as described next.

\subsection{Regridding}  It is common to want to interpolate a coarse grid model state onto a finer grid or vice versa.  For example, one might want to do the EISMINT II experiment F as above, producing \verb|foo.nc|, but then interpolate both the ice thickness and the temperature onto a finer grid.  Speaking conceptually, the idea in PISM is that one starts over from the beginning of EISMINT II experiment F on the finer grid, but one extracts the thickness and ice temperature stored in the coarse grid file and interpolates onto the finer grid before proceeding with the actual computation.  The transfer from grid to grid is reasonably general---one can go from coarse to fine or vice versa in each dimension $x,y,z$---but the transfer must always be done by \emph{interpolation} and never \emph{extrapolation}.  (An attempt to do the latter should always produce a PISM error.)

Such ``regridding'' is done using the \verb|-regrid| and \verb|-regrid_vars| commands as in this example:

\verb|$  pisms -eisII F -Mx 101 -My 101 -Mz 201 -y 1000 \|

\verb|     -regrid foo.nc -regrid_vars HT -o bar|

\noindent Note one specifies ``\verb|HT|'' to indicate that the ice thickness and temperature values from the old grid should be interpolated onto the new grid.  See table \ref{tab:regridvar} for the regriddable variables.  Note that one doesn't need to regrid the bed elevation, which is set identically zero as part of the EISMINT II experiment F description, nor the ice surface elevation, which is computed as the bed elevation plus the ice thickness at each time step anyway.

A slightly different use of regridding occurs when ``bootstrapping'' as described in section \ref{sect:real}.  Here it is reasonable to have the sequence of commands, run on 8 processors,
\small
\begin{verbatim}
mpiexec -n 8 pismr -bif_legacy init.nc -Mx 141 -My 141 -Mz 101 -Mbz 21 -gk -e 1.2 \
   -verbose -y 10 -o ant10yr_40km -of n

mpiexec -n 8 pismr -if ant10yr_40km.nc -gk -e 1.2 -no_mass -y 149990 \
   -o ant150k_40km -of n

mpiexec -n 8 pismr -bif_legacy init.nc -Mx 281 -My 281 -Mz 201 -Mbz 41 -gk -e 1.2 \
   -regrid ant150k_40km.nc -regrid_vars TBeL -verbose -y 10 -o ant150k_20km -of n
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
Here we bootstrap from an incomplete set of data in \verb|init.nc| and smooth the surface for a short 10 year run on a coarseer 40km grid.  Then we do a long simulation to complete 150,000 years on this coarse grid to approximate the temperature and age fields, assuming steady boundary conditions and fixed geometry.  Finally we do a brief 10 year run with evolving geometry on a finer 20km grid, but we go back to the original data for the ice thickness; this last stage involves regridding temperature but not thickness, in particular.


\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Regriddable variables.  Use \texttt{-regrid$\underline{\phantom{b}}$var} with given flag.}\label{tab:regridvar}
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll}\hline
\textbf{Flag} & \textbf{Variable} & \textbf{Comment}\\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{Understanding and controlling adaptive time-stepping} \label{subsect:adapt} Recall that at each time step we get a summary of the model state using a few numbers.  The format of the summary is
\begin{verbatim}
    $$$$$      YEAR (+    STEP[N$]):     VOL    AREA    MELTF     THICK0     TEMP0
\end{verbatim}
Here we will explain what appears in the `\verb|(+    STEP[N$])|' part of this summary.

\verb|STEP| is the time step just taken by PISM, in model years.  This time step is determined by a somewhat complicated adaptive mechanism.  Note that PISM does each step explicitly when numerically approximating mass conservation in the map-plane.  This requires that PISM have adaptive time-stepping for stability in the shallow ice approximation regions.  Other issues like numerically approximating transport of temperature and age require adaptivity too \cite{BBL}.

Note that most of the time `\verb|N|' will be zero.  The exception is when the option \verb|-tempskip| is used.  If \verb|-tempskip| $M$ is used, then \verb|N| will be at most $M$, and will countdown the mass conservation steps when the adaptive scheme determines that a long temperature/age evolution time step, relative to the diffusity controlled time step for mass conservation, would be allowed.  To see an example, do: 

\verb|$  pismv -test G -Mx 141 -My 141 -Mz 51 -tempskip 4|

Table \ref{tab:adaptiveflag} explains the meaning of the one character adaptive-timestepping flag `\verb|$|'.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Meaning of the adaptive time-stepping flag `\texttt{\$}' in `\texttt{(+    STEP[N\$])}'.}\label{tab:adaptiveflag}

\verb|c| & 3D CFL for temperature/age advection \cite{BBL} \\
\verb|d| & diffusivity for SIA mass conservation \cite{BBL} \\
\verb|e| & end of prescribed run time \\
\verb|f| & \verb|-dt_force| set; generally option \verb|-dt_force|, which overrides the adaptive scheme, \\

\end{table}

\subsection{Using signals to control a running PISM model} \label{subsect:signal}  Ice sheet model runs sometimes take a long time and the state of the run needs checking.  Sometimes they need to be stopped, but with the possibility of restarting.  PISM implements these behaviors using ``signals'' from the POSIX standard.  Such signals are included in Linux and most flavors of Unix.  Table \ref{tab:signals} below summarizes how PISM responds to signals.

Here is an example.  Suppose we start a long verification run in the background, with standard out redirected into a file:

\verb|pismv -test G -Mz 101 -y 1e6 -o testGmillion >> log.txt &|

\noindent This run gets a Unix process id (``\verb|pid|''); we will need that number.  (One can get the \verb|pid| by using the \verb|ps| or \verb|pgrep| utilities.)

If we want to observe the run without stopping it we send the \verb|USR1| signal:

\verb|kill -USR1 8920|

\noindent where ``\verb|8920|'' happened to be the \verb|pid| of the running PISM process.  It happens that we caught the run at year 31871.5 or so because a NetCDF file \verb|pism-31871.495239.nc| is produced.  This intermediate state file can be viewed by \verb|ncview pism-31871.495239.nc|.  Note also that in the standard out log file \verb|log.txt| the lines

\verb|...|

\verb|$vtf  31871.495 (+ 30.84701[0d]):   2.985   1.747    0.000   2997.637   272.236|

\verb|Caught signal SIGUSR1: Writing intermediate file `pism-31871.495239.nc'.|

\verb|$vtf  31904.021 (+ 32.52611[0d]):   2.997   1.747    0.000   2997.641   272.235|

\verb|...|

\noindent appear.

Suppose, on the other hand, that the run needs to be stopped.  One may use the interrupt ``\verb|kill -KILL 8920|'' for this process, which is running in the background.  (Foreground processes can be interrupted by Ctrl-C.)  This brutal method, which a process cannot catch or block, stops the process but does not allow it  time to save the model state, which is necessary to restart at the same place, or to inspect the model state more thoroughly.  If one wants the possibility of restarting then one should used the \verb|TERM| signal, 

\verb|kill -TERM 8920|

\noindent Then the PISM run is stopped and the lines

\verb|Caught signal SIGTERM: exiting early.|

\verb|...|

\verb|Writing model state to file `testGmillion.nc' ... done|

\noindent appear in the log file \verb|log.txt|.  In this case the NetCDF model state file \verb|testGmillion.nc| appears; note this file has the original output name specified by the option \verb|-o|.  One can restart and finish the run by the command (for example)

\verb|pismv -test G -if testGmillion.nc -ye 1e6 -o testGmillion_finish >> log_cont.txt &|
\smallskip

Finally we consider a multiple process (MPI) run of PISM.  Here each of the processes must be sent the same signal at the same time.  For example, consider the dialog
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
	~/pism$ mpiexec -n 4 pismv -test C -y 100000 >> log.txt &
	~/pism$ ps
	PID TTY          TIME CMD
	6761 pts/0    00:00:00 mpiexec
	6762 pts/0    00:00:00 pismv
	6763 pts/0    00:00:00 pismv
	6764 pts/0    00:00:00 pismv
	6765 pts/0    00:00:00 pismv
	6770 pts/2    00:00:00 ps
	~/pism$ kill -USR1 6762 6763 6764 6765
	~/pism$ kill -TERM 6762 6763 6764 6765
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
Here the \verb|kill| command sent the signal to all four of the running PISM processes simultaneously.  The \verb|kill -USR1| command caused the NetCDF file \verb|pism-10852.037393.nc| to be written, while \verb|kill -TERM| caused all four processes to end after (collectively, of course) writing \verb|verify.nc|.

If, as in the above situation, one wants to send all \verb|pismv| processes the \verb|-TERM| signal then 

  \verb|pkill -TERM pismv|

\noindent will have the same effect as \verb|kill -TERM| followed by a list of all the \verb|pid|s of \verb|pismv| processes.

\newcommand\pid{\textsl{pid}}
\newcommand\same{(\textsl{same})}

\texttt{pkill -USR1 pismv} & \same & (as above for \verb|pkill|) \\
\hline\normalsize
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{Using the positive degree-day model}  \label{subsect:pdd}  By default the accumulation map in PISM is treated as net annual accumulation.  If the input data is actually annual snow-fall (measured as ice-equivalent) then one must \emph{compute} the net annual accumulation according to some mode of how much of the snow is melted in each model year.  The mass conservation equation for the ice sheet requires the net annual accumulation, in any case.  Also note that the surface temperature map in PISM is the mean annual surface temperature, so without an additional model or input there is no yearly temperature cycle.

A reasonable method for computing the melting of snowfall, optionally used by PISM, first assumes a sinusoidal temperature cycle over the course of the year.  The amount of summer warming is the difference between the peak of this temperature cycle and its mean.  The default temperature cycle has a constant amount of summer warming.  This constant is specified by \verb|-pdd_summer_warming|.  See section \ref{sect:real} for an alternative model.  Note that the mean temperature is grid-point dependent, as specified by the input surface temperature map (data), so the cycle is different at each map-plane grid location, though the amplitude is the same at each grid point in the default case.  Also, note that, by default, the peak of the cycle occurs on August 1, but we do not believe that the specific date for ``mid-summer'' matters detectably to whole ice sheet dynamics or simulations thereof.

The part of this cycle above $0\!\phantom{|}^\circ \text{C}$ is converted to positive degree days.  This number of positive degree days is multiplied by a coefficient (set by \verb|-pdd_factor_snow|) to compute the amount of snow melted.  Of this melted snow, a fraction (\verb|-pdd_refreeze|) is kept as ice.  This ice, plus all unmelted snow (measured as ice-equivalent) is applied as accumulation, unless the number of positive degree days exceeds that required to melt all of the snow-fall in the year.  In this latter case in which there are excess positive degree days available for melting, the number of excess positive degree days is multiplied by a coefficient (\verb|-pdd_factor_ice|) to compute how much ice is melted, so that net ablation occurs (at the given point).

As an additional feature one may add ``white noise'' to the temperature cycle.  More precisely, a normally-distributed, mean zero random temperature increment is added (or subtracted) from the temperature for each day.  These increments are independent over the days of the year, though of course we only have pseudo-randomness \dots, but they are the same over the whole sheet.  Their standard deviation is controlled by \verb|-pdd_std_dev|.  If one wants runs with repeatable randomness, add the option \verb|-pdd_repeatable|.

As an example of this mechanism, first do

\verb|pisms -eisII A -Mx 61 -My 61 -Mz 101 -y 8000 -o foo|

\noindent to get an ice sheet which is large enough to have spread significantly into the ablation zone.  Next observe how it behaves in a warmer ``climate'' \emph{without} the positive degree day model; note that the peak surface temperature in EISMINT II experiment B is 5.0 degrees warmer than that in experiment A \cite{EISMINT00}:

\verb|pisms -eisII B -if foo.nc -y 40|

\noindent In this 40 year run the ice sheet grows a bit.  Now observe how it behaves with the default positive degree day model:

\verb|pisms -eisII B -if foo.nc -y 40 -pdd|

\noindent Note that this latter run is the same as

\verb|pisms -eisII B -if foo.nc -y 40 -pdd_summer_warming 15.0 -pdd_factor_snow 0.003 \|

\verb|  -pdd_factor_ice 0.008 -pdd_refreeze 0.6 -pdd_std_dev 0.0|

\noindent and that any of these options can be adjusted.

A positive degree day model specific to the Greenland ice sheet is used in section \ref{sect:real}.

\begin{quote}  Two types of errors may be distinguished: modelling errors and numerical errors.  Modelling errors arise from not solving the right equations.  Numerical errors result from not solving the equations right.  The assessment of modelling errors is \emph{validation}, whereas the assessment of numerical errors is called \emph{verification} \dots  Validation makes sense only after verification, otherwise agreement between measured and computed results may well be fortuitous.

\subsection{Ideas} ``Verification'' is a crucial task for a code as complicated as PISM.  It is the exclusively mathematical and numerical task of checking that the predictions of the numerical code are close to the predictions of the continuum model (the one which the numerical code claims to approximate).  In particular, one compares exact solutions of the continuum model, in circumstance in which they are available, to the numerical approximations of those solutions.

See \cite{BLKCB} and \cite{BBL} for discussion of verification issues for the isothermal and thermomechanically coupled shallow ice approximation (SIA), respectively, and for exact solutions to these models.  See \cite{SchoofStream} for an exact solution to the MacAyeal equations for ice streams using a plastic till assumption.  \cite{Roache} gives a broader discussion of verification and validation throughout computational fluid dynamics.

In PISM there is a separate executable \verb|pismv| which is used for verification.  The numerical code which is verified by \verb|pismv| is, however, exactly the same lines of code in exactly the same source files as is run by the non-verification executables \verb|pismr|, \verb|pisms|, \verb|pgrn|, etc.  (In technical terms, \verb|pismv| runs a derived class of the core class \verb|IceModel|; all PISM executables run the core class.)

Table \ref{tab:tests} summarizes the many exact solutions contained within PISM.  Note that all of these exact solutions, except tests A and E, are solutions of free boundary problems for partial differential equations.  Table \ref{tab:tests_exec} shows how to run each of them for an example grid, namely one with relatively quick execution time.

\subsection{Refinement}  To meaningfully verify a numerical code one must go down a grid refinement path and measure error for each grid.  By ``a refinement path'' we mean the specification of a sequence of grid cell sizes (e.g.~a sequence of triples $(\Delta x,\Delta y,\Delta t)$ in the two spatial and one time dimension case) which decrease toward the (unreachable) infinite refinement limit $(\Delta x,\Delta y,\Delta t) = (0,0,0)$.  By ``measuring the error for each grid'' we will concretely mean computing two norms, namely both the maximum absolute error anywhere on the grid, relative to the exact solution, and computing the average error on the grid.  (These are essentially the $L^1$ and $L^\infty$ norms and bracketing cases in the largest family of common norms \cite{ReedSimon}.)

The goal is not to see that the error is zero at any stage on the refinement path, or even that the error is small in a predetermined absolute sense, generally.  Rather the goal is to see that the error is trending toward zero, and to measure the rate at which decays.  See \cite{BLKCB,BBL,Roache,Wesseling}.

For an example of a refinement path, consider the runs
\begin{quote}\small\begin{verbatim}
pismv -test B -ys 422.45 -y 25000 -Mx 31 -My 31 -Mz 11
pismv -test B -ys 422.45 -y 25000 -Mx 61 -My 61 -Mz 11
pismv -test B -ys 422.45 -y 25000 -Mx 121 -My 121 -Mz 11
pismv -test B -ys 422.45 -y 25000 -Mx 241 -My 241 -Mz 11
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize\end{quote}
These verify the basic function of the isothermal shallow ice approximation components of PISM in the case of no accumulation.  Note that one specifies the number of grid spaces when running PISM, but this is equivalent to specifying the grid cell sizes if the overall dimensions of the computational box is fixed; see subsection \ref{subsect:coords}.  The exact solution in used here is the Halfar similarity solution \cite{Halfar83}.  The refinement path is the sequence of triples $(\Delta x,\Delta y,\Delta)$ with $\Delta x = \Delta y = 80,40,20,10$ and where $\Delta t$ is determined adaptively by a stability criterion (see subsection \ref{subsect:adapt}).  Note that the vertical grid spacing $\Delta z$ is fixed because this test is isothermal and no dependence of the error is expected from changing $\Delta z$.

The data produced by the above four runs appears in figures 7, 8, 9, and 10 of \cite{BLKCB}.  We see there that the isothermal mass conservation scheme does a reasonable job of approximating the evolving surface.  (But we also acknowledge the fact that future improvements in the numerical scheme can make the error decrease more quickly or slowly.)

For thermocoupled tests one refines in three dimensions.  For example, the runs
\begin{quote}\small\begin{verbatim}
pismv -test G -maxdt 10.0 -y 25000 -Mx 61 -My 61 -Mz 61
pismv -test G -maxdt 10.0 -y 25000 -Mx 91 -My 91 -Mz 91
pismv -test G -maxdt 10.0 -y 25000 -Mx 121 -My 121 -Mz 121
pismv -test G -maxdt 10.0 -y 25000 -Mx 181 -My 181 -Mz 181
pismv -test G -maxdt 10.0 -y 25000 -Mx 241 -My 241 -Mz 241
pismv -test G -maxdt 10.0 -y 25000 -Mx 361 -My 361 -Mz 361
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize\end{quote}
produced figures 13, 14, and 15 of \cite{BBL}.  The last couple of these runs required a supercomputer!  The $361\times 361\times 361$ run involves more than $100$ million unknowns, updated at each of millions of time steps.

\subsection{\texttt{verifynow.py}}  This is the Python script in subdirectory \verb|pism/test/| which organizes the process of verifying PISM.  By default it runs Tests C, G, and I, because these tests exercise most of the numerical methods in PISM, and thus suffice for basic verification.

Three example usages are \begin{itemize}
\item ``\verb|verifynow.py|'' without options will use one processor and do three levels of refinement; this command is equivalent to \verb|verifynow.py -n 1 -l 3 -t CGI|,
\item ``\verb|verifynow.py -n 8 -l 1 --prefix=bin/ --mpido=mpirun/|'' will use \verb|mpirun -np 8| \verb|bin/pismv| as the command and do only one level of refinement, and
\item ``\verb|verifynow.py -n 40 -l 5 -t ABCDEFGIL|'' will use lots of processors to do all possible verification as managed by \verb|verifynow.py|; don't run this unless you are prepared to wait.
\end{itemize}

\noindent In fact, \verb|verifynow.py| takes the following options.  They have both a short form and a long form, \emph{a la} GNU; the default is in brackets:

\optoptdef{l}{levels}{3} specifies number of levels of refinement; $1,2,3,4,5$ are allowed values

\optoptdef{m}{mpido}{\texttt{mpiexec}} how to run PISM as an MPI program

\optoptdef{n}{nproc}{1} specify number of processors to use

\optoptdef{p}{prefix}{} where the PISM executable \verb|pismv| is located

\optoptdef{t}{tests}{CGI} which tests to run

\medskip

\subsection{Example \texttt{verifynow.py} output}  Here is the result of three levels of refinement for tests C, E, G, I, and L.  Note that the errors generally decay, with the notable exception of the surface values of the vertical velocity in test G; compare \cite{SaitoMargin}.  The exact meaning of the various errors is currently only documented in the source files \verb|pism/src/iceCompModel.cc| and \verb|pism/src/iCMthermo.cc|.  Note that timing information is given, so performance, including parallel performance, can be assessed along with accuracy.

\section{Simplified geometry experiments}\label{sect:simp}

\subsection{Historical note}  There have been at least three stages of ice sheet model intercomparisons based on simplified geometry experiments since the early 1990s.

EISMINT I \cite{EISMINT96} was the first of these and involved only the isothermal shallow ice approximation (SIA).  (``EISMINT'' stands for European Ice Sheet Modeling INiTiative.)  Both fixed margin and moving margin experiments were performed in EISMINT I, and various conclusions were drawn about the several numerical schemes used in the intercomparison.  

EISMINT I is, however, superceded by \emph{verification} using the full variety of exact solutions to the isothermal SIA.  The reasons why EISMINT I can be fully replaced by verification are described in \cite{BLKCB}.  The ``rediscovery'', since EISMINT I, of the very useful Halfar similarity solution with zero accumulation \cite{Halfar83} is a particular reason why the ``moving margin'' experiment in EISMINT I is, roughly speaking, irrelevant.  For this reason there has been no attempt to support the EISMINT I experiments in PISM.

EISMINT II \cite{EISMINT00} was both a more significant and more controversial intercomparison.  It pointed out interesting and surprising properties of the thermocoupled SIA.  Here is not the place for a discussion of the interpretations which have followed the EISMINT II results, but references \cite{BBL,Hindmarsh04,Hindmarsh06,PayneBaldwin,SaitoEISMINT} each interpret the EISMINT II experiments and/or describe attempts to add more complete physical models to ``fix'' the perceived shortfalls of ice sheet models.   (I.e.~shortfalls revealed by the EISMINT II results and their interpretations.)  PISM has built-in support for reproduction of all of the published EISMINT II experiments; these are described in the next subsection.

The ISMIP round of intercomparisons are ongoing at the time of this writing (2007); ``ISMIP'' stands for Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project.  At this time there are two components of ISMIP partially completed, namely HOM = Higher Order Models and HEINO = Heinrich Event INtercOmparison \cite{GreveTakahamaCalov}.

Of these ISMIP experiments, PISM currently only supports HEINO, but the results from PISM for HEINO are not regarded by the PISM authors as meaningful.  We believe the continuum problem described by HEINO to not be easily approximate-able because of a (large) discontinuous jump in the basal velocity field.  This is a problem regardless of the details of the numerical schemes or even (roughly speaking) of the shallowness of the continuum model.

As of August 2007, the PISM authors plan to participate in the upcoming ISMIP-POLICE and Marine Ice Sheet Intercomparison exercises.

\subsection{EISMINT II in PISM}  There are seven experiments described in the EISMINT II writeup \cite{EISMINT00}. They are labeled A, B, C, D, F, G, and H.  As specified in the writeup, the common features of all of these experiments are:\begin{itemize}
\item runs are of 200,000 years, with no prescribed time step;
\item runs are on a prescribed $61\times 61$ horizontal grid (but, as usual, the grid and the length of the run are command line options in PISM so PISM can easily run the same experiments on a refined grid);
\item the boundary conditions always have angular symmetry around the center of the grid;
\item the bed is always flat and does not move (so the effects of isostasy were ignored throughout);
\item the temperature in the bedrock is not modelled;
\item only shallow ice approximation physics is included;
\item the change in the temperature of ice is described by the shallow approximation of the conservation of energy \cite{Fowler};
\item thermomechanical coupling is included, both because of the temperature dependence of the softness of the ice, \emph{and} through the strain-heating (dissipation-heating) term in the conservation of energy equation;
\item the ice is \emph{cold} and not \emph{polythermal} \cite{Greve}; and finally
\item though basal melt rates may be computed diagnostically, they do not contribute to the dynamics of the ice sheet.
\end{itemize}
The experiments differ from each other in their various combinations of surface temperature and accumulation parameterizations.  Also, experiments H and G involve basal sliding, while the others don't.  Four experiments start with zero ice (A,F,G,H), while the other experiments (B,C,D) start from the final state of experiment A.

The vertical grid is not specified in the EISMINT II writeup.  It seems that good simulation of the complex thermomechanically coupled conditions near the base of the ice requires relatively fine resolution there.  Because PISM (currently) has an equally-spaced grid, we recommend the use of about 200 vertical levels.

Thus a reasonable experiment A run on four processors is

\verb|mpiexec -n 4 pisms -eisII A -Mx 61 -My 61 -Mz 201 -y 200000 -o eisIIA|

\noindent The final state \verb|eisIIA.nc| can, of course, be viewed using \verb|ncview|.

Table \ref{tab:eisII} shows how each of the EISMINT II experiments can be done in PISM.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Running the EISMINT II experiments in PISM; the command is ``\t{pisms}'' plus these options.}\label{tab:eisII}
\small
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll}\hline
\textbf{Command: ``\t{pisms}'' $+$} & \textbf{Relation to experiment A} \\ \hline
\verb|-eisII A -Mx 61 -My 61 -Mz 201 -y 2e5 -o eisIIA| & \\
\verb|-eisII B -if eisIIA.nc -y 2e5 -o eisIIB| & warmer \\
\verb|-eisII C -if eisIIA.nc -y 200000 -o eisIIC| & less snow \\
\verb|-eisII D -if eisIIA.nc -y 200000 -o eisIID| & smaller area of accumulation \\
\verb|-eisII F -Mx 61 -My 61 -Mz 201 -y 200000 -o eisIIF| & colder; famous spokes \cite{BBL} \\
\verb|-eisII G -Mx 61 -My 61 -Mz 201 -y 200000 -o eisIIG| & sliding (regardless of temperature) \\
\verb|-eisII H -Mx 61 -My 61 -Mz 201 -y 200000 -o eisIIH| & melt-temperature activated sliding \\
\hline\normalsize
\end{tabular}\end{table}

The EISMINT II experiments can be run with various modifications of the default settings.  Certainly the grid can be refined.  For instance, a twice as fine grid in the horizontal is ``\t{-Mx 121 -My 121}''.  Table \ref{tab:eisIIoptions} lists the optional settings which are particular to the EISMINT II experiments; these options will only work if option ``\t{-eisII ?}'' is also set.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Changing the default settings for the EISMINT II experiments in PISM.}\label{tab:eisIIoptions}
\small
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll}\hline
\textbf{Option} & \textbf{Default values [expers]} & \textbf{Units} & \textbf{Meaning} \\ \hline
\verb|-Mmax| & 0.5 [ABDFGH], 0.25 [C] & m$/$a & max value of accumulation rate \\
\verb|-Rel| & 450 [ABFGH], 425 [CD] & km & radial distance to equilibrium line \\
\verb|-Sb| & $10^{-2}$ [\emph{all}] & (m/a)/km & radial gradient of accumulation rate \\
\verb|-ST| & $1.67 \times 10^{-2}$ [\emph{all}] & K/km & radial gradient of surface temperature\\
\verb|-Tmin| & 238.15 [ACDGH], 243.15[B], 223.15[F] & K & max of surface temperature \\ \hline
\verb|-Lz| & 4500 [A], 4000 [BCD], 5000 [F], 3000 [G] & m & height of the computational box \\
\hline\normalsize
\end{tabular}\end{table}

Note that in PISM the height \verb|Lz| of the computational box is fixed at the beginning of the run.  On the other hand, changing the boundary conditions of the flow, as for instance by setting option \verb|-Mmax| to a larger than default value (see table \ref{tab:eisIIoptions}), may cause the ice sheet to thicken above the \verb|Lz| height.  If the ice grows above the height of the computational box then a ``\verb|Vertical grid exceeded!|'' or ``\verb|thickness overflow in SIA velocity: ks>Mz!|'' error occurs.  This can be fixed by remedied by restarting with a larger value for option \verb|-Lz|.


\begin{comment}
\subsection{ISMIP-HEINO in PISM}  The goal of the ISMIP-HEINO intercomparison is to evaluate the degree to which the thermomechanically coupled shallow ice approximation with basal sliding is a model for the surge behavior of the Laurentide ice sheet which is believed to have caused the ``Heinrich events'' described in [CITE HEINRICH].  Further information about HEINO, including the intercomparison description [URL FOR HEINO PDF] can be found at \url{http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~calov/heino.html}.

HEINO involves eight different runs of 200,000 years on a prescribed $81\times 81$ grid in the horizontal.  As in EISMINT II there is no prescription of vertical grid.  During the entirety of each run certain integrated quantities (area, melted base area, etc.) and other quantities measured at prescribed basal points must be reported at each year into ASCII files with \verb|.dat| extensions.  During the last 50,000 years of each of the eight runs, a map-plane (``planform'') dump of other quantities must be made to additional \verb|.dat| ASCII files.  These latter dumps must be made at the time of maximum and minimum extents of various quantities and the only way to determine the time of maximum/minimum extents is to complete the 200,000 year runs, determine the times of maximum and minimums, and then rerun the last 50,000 years from the saved state at 150,000 years.  See the intercomparison description [CITE URL for PDF].

PISM handles all the difficult details of the procedures described in the previous paragraph, but it is important for the user to have a sense for what is supposed to be reported.

HEINO is a relatively expensive intercomparison in terms of computer time.  For this reason use of a multiprocessor machine is recommended though not essential.  If the intercomparison participant's initials were X.~Y.~Z.~then a HEINO run ST is the recipe

\verb|mpiexec -n 8 pisms -ismip H -run ST -Mx 81 -My 81 -Mz 281 \|

\verb|    -y 150000 -dat_prefix XYZ_START -o XYZ_ST_150k|

\verb|mpiexec -n 8 pisms -ismip H -run ST -if XYZ_ST_150k.nc \|

\verb|    -y 50000 -dat_prefix XYZ_END -o XYZ_ST_200k|

[use Matlab to determine max/min]

\verb|mpiexec -n 8 pisms -ismip H -run ST -if XYZ_ST_150k.nc \|

\verb|    -y 50000 -time1 -time2 -time3 -time4 -dat_prefix XYZ_RERUN|

\verb|~/pism/test/heinocatdat.sh XYZ_ST_??? ...|

\verb|~/pism/test/renames.sh | [rename planform files?]

\noindent At the end of the above recipe the files [list] should appear.

\section{Realistic ice sheet and ice shelf modelling: two examples}\label{sect:real}

\subsection{Modelling the Greenland ice sheet}  In this subsection we give an extended example of how to use PISM to model the Greenland ice sheet using somewhat out-of-date data.  That is, we perform the ice sheet modelling experiment (intercomparison) known as EISMINT-Greenland \cite{RitzEISMINT}.  As stated earlier, real data is not something we can freely distribute under the GNU Public License.  The data for performing this intercomparison is, however, freely available at
\medskip

\centerline{\protect{\textbf{\url{http://homepages.vub.ac.be/~phuybrec/eismint/greenland.html}}}}
\medskip

The data for this intercomparison is not new.  The snow-fall accumulation map, ablation parameterization, surface temperature formula, surface elevation, and bedrock elevation maps are essentially as in the 1991 papers \cite{Letreguillyetal1991,OhmuraReeh}.  In the ice and sea floor-core driven ``forced climate'' run \verb|-ccl3| described below, the ice sheet is forced by changes in temperature from the GRIP core \cite{Dansgaardetal1993} and by changes in sea level from SPECMAP \cite{Imbrieetal1984}.  (Newer data, and even some newer understanding, is available in 2007.  The reader is encouraged to go and build a better Greenland model than the tutorial example here.)

\subsubsection{Obtaining and converting EISMINT-Greenland data}  This subsection describes the use of two Python scripts to convert the EISMINT-Greenland data into NetCDF files useable by PISM.

The Python scripts \verb|eis_green.py| and \verb|eis_core.py| can be found in the \verb|pism/test| directory.  In order to use the scripts, you must have downloaded the following ascii data files from the above web site:\begin{itemize}
 \item \verb|grid20-EISMINT| (or \verb|grid40-EISMINT|)
 \item \verb|suaq20-EISMINT| (or \verb|suaq40-EISMINT|)
 \item \verb|specmap.017|
 \item \verb|sum89-92-ss09-50yr.stp|
\end{itemize}
The Python libraries \verb|numpy| (\url{http://numpy.scipy.org/}) and \verb|pycdf| (\url{http://pysclint.sourceforge.net/pycdf/}) must also be present.  Note that the scripts \verb|eis_green.py| and \verb|eis_core.py| can both take option \verb|--prefix=foo/| to specify that the downloaded data is in directory \verb|foo/|.  The script \verb|eis_green.py| has an option (\verb|-g|) which allows the modeler to specify that either the 20 km (default) or 40 km data be converted to NetCDF; use \verb|-g 40| for the coarser data.

Run

\verb|  eis_green.py --prefix=foo/ -g 20|

The NetCDF file \verb|eis_green20.nc| (or \verb|eis_green40.nc|) will be created, in the current directory, from the data in \verb|grid20-EISMINT| and \verb|suaq20-EISMINT|.  It contains variables for the gridded latitude (\verb|lat|), longitude (\verb|lon|), surface altitude (\verb|h|), bedrock altitude (\verb|b|), and ice thickness (\verb|H|).  These values can be viewed graphically with \verb|ncview| or as long text files with \verb|ncdump|.

As an exercise, the NCO (\url{http://nco.sourceforge.net/}) can be used on \verb|eis_green20.nc| to compare the putative ice surface elevation to the sum of the ice thickness and the bed elevation:

\verb|  ncap -O -vs "check=h-(H+b)" eis_green20.nc eis_green_check.nc|

\noindent The variable \verb|check| in the output file holds the difference of \verb|h| and $\verb|b|+\verb|H|$.  Viewing this variable will show that \verb|h| is within 1 meter of $\verb|b|+\verb|H|$.  Thus the surface elevation \verb|h| is consistent.  It is also redundant: at bootstrapping PISM simply reads ice thickness \verb|H| and bed elevation \verb|b| and computes ice surface elevation as the sum of these two; the ice surface elevation variable \verb|h| is not actually read from the bootstrapping NetCDF file.

It also should be noted that bed elevation (\verb|b|) contains a missing value attribute of $0.0$ because in several places (deep fjords, apparently) the bed elevation was not measured or trusted.  When viewing this data in \verb|ncview|, these values show as white spots. If these missing values are left in then the bed elevation map is extraordinarily rough and this makes reasonable ice flow predictions essentially impossible.  We therefore suggest smoothing this aspect of the data.  This can be done with another script named \verb|fill_missing.py|, found in directory \verb|pism/test/|. To use this script, the following command can be run:

\verb|  fill_missing.py -i eis_green20.nc -v b -o eis_green_smoothedbed.nc|

\noindent Here, \verb|eis_green20.nc| is the input file, \verb|b| is the variable with missing values, and \verb|eis_green_smoothed.nc| is the output file. The script will look for an attribute named \verb|missing_value| and fill in the missing values according to the averages of its neighbors.  Multiple variables can be fixed at the same time by separating the variable names by commas.  (That is,\\
\verb|fill_missing.py -i data.nc -v b,H,Ts -o data_smoothed.nc|.  Note that \emph{each} of the listed variables must have an attribute named \verb|missing_value|.)

In addition to getting the EISMINT gridded data into a NetCDF format and filling missing values, there is an issue with Ellesmere Island.  Ellesmere Island is very close to Greenland, and so it is possible for the modelled ice sheet to flow onto to it, and indeed this presumably occurred at the last glacial maximum.  Since we don't, however, have correct topography or accumulation rates for Ellesmere Island we want to prevent this from happening.  Therefore special code runs when \verb|pgrn| is used (see below) which says that all points northwest of the line connecting the points $(68.18^\circ E, 80.1^\circ N)$ and $(62^\circ E, 82.24^\circ N)$ are removed from the flow simulation.  The same applies to anything east of $30^\circ E$ and south of $67^\circ N$ so that the flow could not spread to the tip of Iceland (not likely).  (``Removed from the flow simulation'' actually means marked as ice-free ocean; note the use of option \verb|-ocean_kill| below.)

Recall we mentioned the script \verb|eis_core.py| as well.  Just execute it, possibly giving the directory where the ice core and sea bed core data \verb|specmap.017| and \verb|sum89-92-ss09-50yr.stp| are found, if that is not the current directory:

\verb|  eis_core.py --prefix=foo/|

Two NetCDF files with one-dimensional (time series) data will be created, namely \verb|grip_dT.nc| and \verb|specmap_dSL.nc|.  These can be \verb|ncview|ed or \verb|ncdump|ed.

\subsubsection{Bootstrapping with EISMINT-Greenland data}  Once the EISMINT Greenland data is obtained and converted to NetCDF, bootstrapping can begin.  This 100 year run is a basic version, shown with \verb|-verbose| to suggest the many aspects of ``bootstrapping'':

\noindent Since the EISMINT Greenland data does not contain certain variables necessary to initialize PISM in the sense of initial values for the relevant partial differential equations, this bootstrapping mode fills in several default values.  (As noted in section \ref{sect:boot} we are doing naive inverse modeling.)  For instance, the variables \verb|Ts|, \verb|ghf|, \verb|uplift|, and \verb|Hmelt| were not found in the \verb|-bif| file.  Thus, these variables were filled with default \verb|263.15|, \verb|0.042|, \verb|0|, and \verb|0| respectively. Also, recall that the EISMINT Greenland data had redundant surface elevation (\verb|h|) values, we see that \verb|h| is ignored and PISM uses the sum of bed elevation and ice thickness ``\verb|h = b + H|''.

\subsubsection{Running the EISMINT-Greenland steady state experiments}  There are several experiments that can be run using command line arguments with \verb|pgrn|.  Some of them require the use of more python scripts, while single line commands are sufficient for others.

The first experiment is a steady state run ``SSL2'' which uses the parameters specified in the EISMINT-Greenland description \cite{RitzEISMINT}. This experiment is intended to be run until the model reaches a ``steady state'', which means a particular standard for a small volume change rate (less than a .01\% change in volume in 10,000 years).  To run this experiment, there is a script that automates the process so that it is not necessary to manually check the changes in volume . This script is called \verb|ssl_exper.py| and can be found in the \verb|pism/test| directory.  When run, it will continue, saving states every 10,000 years, until the change in volume is less than .01\% between 10,000 year runs.  It can be used with multiple processors by setting the option \verb|-n|, for example:

\verb|  ssl_exper.py -n 8|

One can also give a \verb|-ssl3 -gk| option to \verb|pgrn|, or a \verb|--ssl3| option to \verb|ssl_exper.py|.  This gives a particular interpretation to the SSL3 experiment which is described in \cite{RitzEISMINT}, namely that the Goldsby-Kohlstedt flow law \cite{GoldsbyKohlstedt} with an enhancement factor of 1.0 will be used.  (There is no assertion that this choice is superior at this point.)

\subsubsection{Climate forcing from GRIP and SPECMAP}  The next experiment is intended to be carried out after the completion of the steady state run (above) using the saved steady model state. 

Recall that the NetCDF files \verb|grip_dT.nc| and \verb|specmap_dSL.nc| contain time series data for change in surface temperature and the change in sea level.  The options \verb|-dTforcing| and \verb|-dSLforcing| for \verb|pgrn| can use these data for a ``CCL3'' run \cite{RitzEISMINT} under PISM.  Before every time step, \verb|pgrn| adds in a change to the surface temperature and sea level in order to incorporate the effects of global climate changes.  The data in \verb|grip_dT.nc| goes about 250,000 years into the past, while the data in \verb|specmap_dSL.nc| goes back about 780,000 years, but EISMINT-Greenland specifies that the run will start at the beginning of the GRIP data.  Thus we manually set the starting year using the option \verb|-ys|.  The CCL3 experiment can be run using the following command:

\verb|  pgrn -ccl3 -if green20_SSL3.nc -dTforcing grid_dT.nc \|

\verb|    -dSLforcing specmap_dSL.nc -ys -249900 -ye 0 -o green20_CCL3_y0|

\noindent EISMINT-Greenland also calls for a baseline run for another 500 years which starts from the end of the CCL3 run and has steady current climate forcing.  If \verb|pgrn -ccl3| is run past year 0, and thus past then end of the GRIP and SPECMAP data, this baseline run will occur by default.  So the previous command can be run for another 500 years, and the forcing can be omitted:

\verb|  pgrn -ccl3 -if green20_CCL3_y0.nc -y 500 -o green20_CCL3_y500|

\subsubsection{A greenhouse warming scenario}  A final ``greenhouse warming'' experiment ``GWL3'' is described in the EISMINT-Greenland \cite{RitzEISMINT}.  It uses the model state obtained for present day from the CCL3 run.  Using the previous commands, this is the file named \verb|green20_CCL3_y0.nc|.  The GWL3 experiment (option \verb|-gwl3|) is intended to be run for 500 years with the temperature increasing by $0.035^\circ C/$year for the first 80 years, then at a rate of $0.0017^\circ C/$year for the last 420 years:

\verb|  pgrn -gwl3 -if green20_CCL3_y0.nc -y 500 -o green20_GWL3|


\subsection{Validation of PISM as a flow model for the Ross ice shelf} Recall that we use the term ``validation'' to describe the comparison of model output with physical observations in cases where those physical observations are believed to be sufficiently complete and of sufficient quality so that the performance of the numerical model can be assessed.  Roughly speaking, in validation the observations or data are better than the model, so the comparison tells one about the quality of the model and not the quality or incompleteness of the data.

As part of the first EISMINT series of intercomparisons, MacAyeal and others \cite{MacAyealetal} performed a validation of several ice shelf numerical models using the Ross ice shelf as an example.  We will refer to this intercomparison and its associate write-up \cite{MacAyealetal} as ``EISMINT-Ross''.  The models were compared to data from the RIGGS (= Ross Ice shelf Geophysical and Glaciological Survey) \cite{RIGGS1,RIGGS2}.  The RIGGS data were acquired in the period 1973--1978.   In particular, the RIGGS data include the (horizontal) velocity of the ice shelf measured at a few hundred locations in a reasonably regular grid across the shelf; see figure \ref{fig:rossmatlab} below for an indicaiton of these positions.

A parameter-sensitivity study of a particular Ross ice shelf numerical model is described in \cite{HumbertGreveHutter}.

\subsubsection{Bringing in the data}  Using these data to validate PISM's ice shelf modelling abilities requires downloading (text) data files from the website \url{http://homepages.vub.ac.be/~phuybrec/eismint/iceshelf.html}.  In particular, these files must be downloaded:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|111by147Grid.dat|
\item \verb|kbc.dat|
\item \verb|inlets.dat|
\end{itemize}
In the next step we will assume that these three files are in a directory \verb|eisDownload/|, and we will refer to these as the ``EISMINT-Ross'' data.  Note that these data are for a particular rectangular grid with $6.822$km spacing in both $x$ and $y$ directions, but that (as usual) the PISM computational grid is determined by the user.

The first step for using these data, as usual for PISM, is to convert them to a machine readable NetCDF file.  There is already a script \verb|eis_ross.py| for this purpose in subdirectory \verb|pism/test/ross/|.  It  reads the above three EISMINT-Ross \verb|.dat| files and it creates a NetCDF file with the data and some metadate needed by PISM.  It is used this way:

\verb|test/ross/eis_ross.py --prefix=eisDownload/ -o ross.nc|

\noindent The output file can be reconverted to text (CDL) using \verb|ncdump| or it can be viewed graphically with \verb|ncview|.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics[height=2.3in,keepaspectratio=true]{figs/rossmask} \qquad \includegraphics[height=2.3in,keepaspectratio=true]{figs/rossubar}
\caption{Two views from \protect{\texttt{ncview}} of the EISMINT-Ross data in the NetCDF file \protect{\texttt{ross.nc}}.  The floating-versus-grounded mask (left; red areas are floating ice shelf) and the $x$-component of the non-zero kinematic (Dirichlet) boundary condition for velocity (right).}
\label{fig:rossmaskubar}
\end{figure}

The NetCDF file \verb|ross.nc| contains ice thickness, bed elevations, surface temperature, and accumulation, and all of these are typical of ice sheet modelling data.  It also has variables \verb|ubar| and \verb|vbar| which give the boundary values which are needed for the diagnostic computation of velocity.  Also present are the variables \verb|mask|, which shows the domain where the ice shelf is modelled, and \verb|bcflag|, which shows the locations where the boundary conditions are to be applied.  Note that the original EISMINT-Ross data are on a 111 by 147 grid but that \verb|eis_ross.py| extends this grid to a more convenient 147 by 147 grid, with the same $6.822$km spacing, which has ice-free ocean beyond the (straightened; compare \cite{MacAyealetal}) calving front.  See figure \ref{fig:rossmaskubar}.

\subsubsection{Diagnostic computation of ice shelf velocity}  The basic Ross ice shelf velocity computation from these data might be:

\verb|   pismd -ross -bif ross.nc -ssaBC ross.nc -Mx 147 -My 147 -Mz 11 -mv|

\noindent Here we bootstrap (\verb|-bif|) from \verb|ross.nc|.  We also use option \verb|-ssaBC| to specify \verb|ross.nc| as the source of the boundary value data for the ice shelf equations, as mentioned in the last paragraph.  The computational grid specified here is the $6.822$ km data grid in EISMINT-Ross with 147 grid points in each direction.  Note that the small number of vertical levels (\verb|-Mz 11|) is reasonable because the EISMINT-Ross intercomparison specifies that the temperature at depth be the surface temperature \cite{MacAyealetal}, and thus there is no thermocoupling issue.

At the end of this run the computed velocity field is compared to the interpolated data on observed velocities in the file \verb|ross.nc|.  (In particular, that NetCDF file contains a variable \verb|accur| which identifies the region in which the observed velocities are valid.  The observed (interpolated) velocities themselves are stored in variables \verb|mag_obs| and \verb|azi_obs|.)  We see that the largest computed velocity in the ice shelf is just under a thousand meters per year, and that errors in the vector values of velocity are roughly 10\% in a sum of squares average sense.  (There is more on viewing the results, on measuring the correspondence with measurements, and on tuning the hardness parameter to fit the data, below.)

There are many variations on this basic ``\verb|pismd -ross|'' run above.  First of all one can get more information during the run by adding diagnositic viewers and a more complete (verbose) report to standard out:

\verb|   pismd -ross -bif ross.nc -ssaBC ross.nc -Mx 147 -My 147 -Mz 11 -mv \|

\verb|     -d cnmu -verbose 4 -pause 10|

\noindent Secondly one might want to do the run in parallel, do it on a finer grid, and ask for higher tolerance.  For example, 

\small
\verb|   mpiexec -n 6 pismd -ross -bif ross.nc -ssaBC ross.nc -Mx 201 -My 201 -Mz 11 -mv|
\normalsize

The result is not exactly the same [but really good; FIXME].

Alternately one might want to change the hardness parameter from the default value $\bar B = 1.9 \times 10^8 \, \text{Pa}\, \text{s}^{1/3}$ \cite{MacAyealetal} to a slightly softer value because the highest computed velocity with the default setting is a little lower than the maximum measured in the RIGGS data (namely, $1007$ m/a; see files \verb|pism/test/ross/README| and \verb|pism/test/ross/riggs_clean.dat|).   We can also use lower (more severe) tolerances for the nonlinear iteration (\verb|-mv_rtol|) and the linear iteration (\verb|-ksp_rtol|) to get more confidence in the numerical scheme.   Finally we can also save the model state with a meaningful name:

\verb|   pismd -ross -bif ross.nc -ssaBC ross.nc -Mx 147 -My 147 -Mz 11 -mv \|

\verb|     -verbose 4 -constant_hardness 1.8e8 -mv_rtol 1e-6 -ksp_rtol 1e-10 \|

\verb|     -o ross_out_1p8|

\noindent Using \verb|ncview| on \verb|ross_out_1p8.nc| to view the horizontal speed of the ice shelf gives figure \ref{fig:rossspeed1p8}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics[height=3.5in,keepaspectratio=true]{figs/rossspeed1p8}
\caption{Computed horizontal speed of the Ross ice shelf using $\bar B = 1.8 \times 10^8 \, \text{Pa}\, \text{s}^{1/3}$.  Color gives velocity in m/a; see scale.}

\normalsize

Table \ref{tab:rossoptions} lists some of the options which are useful for this kind of diagnositic velocity computation.

\subsubsection{Comparison to RIGGS data}  The file \verb|riggs_clean.dat| in directory \verb|pism/test/ross/| is a cleaned-up version of the original RIGGS data \cite{RIGGS1, RIGGS2}.  To convert this data to a NetCDF file, as needed next, do

\verb|   cd test/ross/|

\verb|   ./eis_riggs.py -o riggs.nc|

\noindent A file \verb|riggs.nc| will be created.  Note that the data is one-dimensional in this NetCDF file, that is, it is just some lists of values with an index dimension \verb|count|.  (See \verb|pism/test/ross/README| for more explanation on this RIGGS data.)

Now, \verb|pismd -ross| can read this data and compute a $\chi^2$ statistic comparing model output to the data.  Assuming one is in the \verb|pism/test/ross/| directory, and that both \verb|ross.nc| and \verb|riggs.nc| are in this directory, this command will produce a $\chi^2$ statistic:

\small\begin{verbatim}
$ pismd -ross -bif ross.nc -ssaBC ross.nc -Mx 147 -My 147 -Mz 11 -mv -riggs riggs.nc
PISMD: initializing EISMINT Ross ice shelf velocity computation ...
...
maximum computed speed in ice shelf is    951.113 (m/a)
...
comparing to RIGGS is data in riggs.nc ...
Chi^2 statistic for computed results compared to RIGGS is   5390.542
 ... done.
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Naturally, the question is ``does this $\chi^2$ value of $5390.5$ represent a good fit of model result to observations''?  Also naturally, there is no objective answer.  For comparison, Table 1 in \cite{MacAyealetal} is reproduced here as Table \ref{tab:chisqr}.  As noted, all these results are with a constant hardness parameter $\bar B = 1.9 \times 10^8 \, \text{Pa}\, \text{s}^{1/3}$ \cite{MacAyealetal}.  The maximum computed horizontal ice speed above of $951.1$ m/a is lower than the maximum velocities reported by the other models but, on the other hand, the maximum measured speed in the RIGGS data set is $1007$ m/a (near the calving front, of course).

\small
\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Model performance index, $\chi^2$ (non-dimensional).  \protect{\textsl{(Reproduction of Table 1 in \cite{MacAyealetal}.)}}}\label{tab:chisqr}
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll}\hline
\textsl{Model} & $\chi^2$ & \textsl{Maximum velocity} \\
 & & $\text{m}\,\text{a}^{-1}$ \\ \hline
Bremerhaven1 & 3605 & 1379 \\
Bremerhaven2 & 12\,518 & 1663 \\
Chicago1 & 5114 & 1497 \\
Chicago2 & 5125 & 1497 \\
Grenoble & 5237 & 1508 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\normalsize

\subsubsection{Tuning the ice hardness for a better fit to RIGGS}  Because there is a relatively rich data set from RIGGS on ice velocity, it is reasonable to ask whether the PISM computed velocities can fit the data better if the hardness parameter $\bar B$ is adjusted.  There is a Python script \verb|pism/test/ross/tune.py| which runs \verb|pismd -ross| with several values of $\bar B$.  By default it uses smaller values for the convergence tolerances, and it can be run with multiple processors.  We see that with a hardness $\bar B = 1.7 \times 10^8 \, \text{Pa}\, \text{s}^{1/3}$ we get a maximum computed speed of $1256.8$ m/a and a $\chi^2$ of $3398.0$.  To the extent that we are comparing apples to apples, so to speak, this is more-or-less as good as any of the results reported \cite{MacAyealetal}.

\subsubsection{Additional visualization using \Matlab output from PISM}  The visualization abilities of PISM's runtime viewers and of \verb|ncview| (applied to the PISM output NetCDF file) are limited.  PISM can save certain variables in a \Matlab-readable form, however, and this is a situation where it might be useful.

\verb|   pismd -ross -bif ross.nc -ssaBC ross.nc -riggs riggs.nc \|

\verb|     -ksp_rtol 1e-08 -mv_rtol 1e-05 -Mx 147 -My 147 -Mz 11 -mv \|

\verb|     -constant_hardness 1.7e8 -o ross1p7 -of m|

\noindent When this completes, make sure \Matlab can find \verb|ross1p7.m| and also files \verb|ross_plot.m| and \verb|riggs_clean.dat| (both in directory \verb|pism/test/ross/|).  Execute the \verb|m|-files as commands:

\verb|>> ross1p7|

\verb|>> ross_plot|

\noindent Figure \ref{fig:rossmatlab} is the result.  We have succeeded in modeling a real ice shelf.

\section{Inside PISM: overviews of models, schemes, and sources}\label{sect:over}

\subsection{The continuum models in PISM}  Significant features of the continuum model approximated by the PISM include:\begin{itemize}
\item The inland ice sheet is modeled with the thermocoupled shallow ice approximation equations \cite{Fowler}, and some temperature-activated basal sliding is allowed.
\item Ice shelves and ice streams are modeled by shallow equations which describe flow by longitudinal strain rates and basal sliding.  These equations are different from the shallow ice approximation.  In shelves and streams the velocities are independent of depth within the ice.  The equations were originally established for ice shelves \cite{Morland,MorlandZainuddin,MacAyealetal}.  They were adapted for ice streams, as ``dragging ice shelves,'' by MacAyeal \cite{MacAyeal}; see also \cite{HulbeMacAyeal}.
\item The regions of grounded ice in which the ice stream model is applied can be determined from mass balance velocities \cite{BamberVaughanJoughin}, from observed surface velocities, or from a plastic till assumption and the associated free boundary problem \cite{SchoofStream}.
\item A three dimensional age field is computed.
\item A temperature model for the bedrock under an ice sheet is included.
\item Geothermal flux which varies in the map-plane can be used, for instance based on the new Antarctic results in \cite{ShapiroRitzwoller} and \cite{FoxMaule}.
\item Within the shallow ice sheet regions the model can use the constitutive relation of Goldsby and Kohlstedt \cite{GoldsbyKohlstedt,Peltieretal}.  For inclusion in this flow law, grain size can be computed using a age-grain size relation from the Vostok core data \cite{VostokCore}, for example.
\item The Lingle-Clark \cite{BLKfastearth,LingleClark} bed deformation model can be used.  It combines a spherical elastic earth and viscous half-space asthenosphere/mantle.  It generalizes the better known elastic lithosphere, relaxing asthenosphere (``ELRA'') model \cite{Greve2001}.  This model can be initialized by an observed bed uplift map \cite{BLKfastearth}, or even an uplift map computed by an external model like that in \cite{IvinsJames2005}.\end{itemize}

Many of the parts of the model described above are optional.  For instance, the Paterson-Budd-Glen \cite{PatersonBudd} flow can replace the Goldsby-Kohlstedt law, a simple isostasy model can be substituted for the more sophisticated one, and so on.  Options can be chosen at the command line as described in section \ref{sect:options} above.

The following features are \emph{not} included in the continuum model, and would (or will) require major additions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Inclusion of all components of the stress tensor (i.e.~longitudinal stresses within the shallow ice approximation region and additional shear stress components in shelves/streams) through either an intermediate order scheme \cite{Blatter,Hindmarsh06,SaitoEISMINT} or the full Stokes equations \cite{Fowler}.
\item A model for water--content within the ice.  In the current model the ice is \emph{cold} and not \emph{polythermal}; compare \cite{Greve}.  On the other hand, in the current model the energy used to melt the ice within a given column, if any, is conserved.  In particular, a layer of basal melt water evolves by conservation of energy in the column.  This layer can activate basal sliding and its latent heat energy is available for refreezing.
\item A model for basal water mass conservation in the map-plane; compare \cite{JohnsonFastook}.
\item A fully spherical Earth deformation model, for example one descended from the Earth model of \cite{Peltier}, like the one used to estimate current Antarctic uplift in \cite{IvinsJames2005}.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{The numerical schemes in PISM}  Significant features of the numerical methods in PISM include:\begin{itemize}
\item Verification \cite{Roache} is a primary concern and is built into the code.  Nontrivial verifications are available for isothermal ice sheet flow \cite{BLKCB}, thermocoupled sheet flow \cite{BB,BBL}, the earth deformation model \cite{BLKfastearth}, the coupled (ice flow)/(earth deformation) system in an isothermal and pointwise isostasy  case \cite{BLKfastearth}, and the MacAyeal equations for ice stream flow \cite{SchoofStream,BrownPresentation}.
\item The code is \emph{structurally} parallel.  In fact, the PETSc toolkit is used at all levels \cite{petsc-user-ref}.  PETSc manages the MPI-based communication between processors, and provides an interface to parallel numerical linear algebra and other numerical functions.
\item The grid can be chosen at the command line.  Regridding can be done at any time, for example taking the result of a rough grid computation and interpolating it onto a finer grid.
\item A moving boundary technique is used for the temperature equation which does not stretch the vertical in a singular manner; the Jenssen \cite{Jenssen} change of variables is not used.
\item The model uses an explicit time stepping method for flow and a partly implicit method for temperature.  Advection of temperature is upwinded \cite{MortonMayers}.  As described  in  \cite{BBL}, reasonably rigorous stability criteria are applied to the time-stepping scheme, including a diffusivity-based criteria for the explicit mass continuity scheme and a CFL criteria \cite{MortonMayers} for temperature/age advection.
\item The local truncation error is generically first order (i.e.~$O(\Delta x,\Delta y,\Delta z,\Delta t)$).
\item MacAyeal equations \cite{MacAyeal,SchoofStream} are used to determine velocity in the ice shelf and ice stream regions.  Like the full non-Newtonian Stokes equations, they are nonlinear and nonlocal equations for the velocity given the geometry of the streams and shelves and given the ice temperature.  They are solved by straightforward iteration of linearized equations with numerically-determined (vertically-averaged) viscosity.  Either plastic till or linear drag is allowed.  As with all of PISM, the numerical approximation is finite difference.  The linearized finite difference equations are solved by any of the Krylov subspace methods in PETSc \cite{BrownPresentation,petsc-user-ref}.
\item The bed deformation model is implemented by a new Fourier collocation (spectral) method \cite{BLKfastearth}.
\item Implementation is in C++ and is object-oriented.  For example, verification occurs in a derived class.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{The PISM source code} This ice sheet model is implemented as a collection of C++ object classes, the most central of which is \t{IceModel}.  Actually there are three basic classes to know about, all of which are in \verb|pism/src/base/|:
\begin{itemize}
\item \t{IceGrid}, which describes the shape of the grid and parallel
layout. This abstraction could be used to streamline transferring model data between
different grids.
\item \t{MaterialType}.  Various materials are derived from the class \t{MaterialType} which merely defines a couple physical constants. \t{IceType} is a derived class, but still an abstract class. which defines the physical properties of ice as a material.  Concrete classes derived from \t{IceType} are \t{ThermoGlenIce} (which uses the
EISMINT constants) and \t{GKIce} as well as \t{HybridIce}, which implements the Goldsby-Kohlstedt flow law \cite{GoldsbyKohlstedt}.\footnote{Actually, it is difficult or impossible to implement a complete Goldsby-Kohlstedt \t{IceType} because the inverse constitutive relation is required for computation of MacAyeal-type ice shelf and dragging ice shelf \cite{MacAyeal} velocity fields. \t{HybridIce} is Goldsby-Kohlstedt ice in the interior of the ice sheet and Glen ice in ice streams and
shelves.}  Similarly, there is \t{BedrockType} and \t{OceanType} which merely define
associated physical constants.
\item \t{IceModel} which contains myriad data structures, flags, PETSc \verb|Vec|s (below), and most of the methods and numerical methods of PISM.\end{itemize}

The methods for \t{IceModel} are many, as noted.  In addition to numerics, they initialize the model (from input data files or from formulas describing various exact solutions), they read user options, they allocate arrays in a distributed manner under PETSc (below), they control diagnostic viewers, they run the adaptive time-stepping mechanism, they report the state of PISM to the user, and they write out the model state to files.

A derived class of \t{IceModel} called \t{IceCompModel} is used for verification.  It has additional structures which allows \t{IceModel} to have compensatory sources and compute initial conditions from, and especially to report errors relative to, known exact solutions \cite{BLKCB,BBL,BB}.  Another derived class used for verification is \t{IceExactStreamModel}, which implements the exact solution described in \cite{SchoofStream}.

Other derived classes of \t{IceModel} are \t{IceEISModel}, \t{IceGRNModel}, and \t{IceROSSModel}.  These correspond to simplified geometry experiments, the EISMINT-Greenland, and the EISMINT-Ross ice shelf models described in this manual.

There are five established drivers which in essense just call constructors and destructors for \t{IceModel} or a derived class thereof, and tell it to go.  These are in the source files \verb|pgrn.cc|, \verb|pismd.cc|, \verb|pismr.cc|, \verb|pisms.cc|, and \verb|pismv.cc|.  These correspond to the executables \verb|pgrn|, \verb|pismd|, \verb|pismr|, \verb|pisms|, and \verb|pismv|, respectively.  These drivers do no computation but differ in which derived class is constructed and in how certain options are handled.  The driver \verb|pismr.cc| and its executable \verb|pismr| only use the base class \verb|IceModel|; it requires a pre-existing saved PISM model state to start.

The different derived classes generally invoke the same numerical procedures to handle the various partial differential equations of the continuum model.  In the case of \t{IceCompModel}, this fact is at the heart of the verification mechanism.

\subsection{PETSc: An overview for PISM users}  The PETSc library \cite{petsc-user-ref,petsc-efficient} provides essential support for distributed arrays and linear solvers in a parallel computing environment.  ``PETSc'' stands for ``Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation.''  It is a suite of data structures and routines in C for the scalable parallel solution of partial differential equations and their scientific applications.  Large parts of PETSc relate especially to finite-difference-type regular, rectangular grids but PETSc has been used for unstructured grids as well.  Documentation for PETSc is available from the web site at \url{http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-as/}.  PETSc employs the MPI standard for all message-passing communication.  PETSc is deliberately at a higher level of abstraction than MPI; PETSc protects the programmer from explicit consideration of message passing.

Most variables in a PETSc program are of newly-defined distributed types including
\begin{verbatim}
DA   da;
Vec  v;
KSP  ksp;
\end{verbatim}
In fact most of the PETSc types merely declare pointers but they should be regarded as objects (abstract data types).  The objects must be created with calls to functions like \t{DACreate2d()}, \t{VecCreate()}, etc.  They should be destroyed when they are not needed with calls to corresponding \t{Destroy()} functions.

\subsubsection{Distributed arrays and vectors} PETSc has an abstract date type called a Distributed Array (DA). Objects of type DA contain
information about the grid and stencil. They can have information about coordinates, but
the code does not use this feature at present. Vectors are created with
\texttt{DAVecCreate()} and similar. These vectors will be distributed across the
processors as indicated by the distributed array.

There are two parameters of note: stencil type and stencil width.  The stencil types are
\verb|DA_STENCIL_STAR| and \verb|DA_STENCIL_BOX|.  They are generalizations of the five
point and nine point stencils typical of two dimensional discretizations respectively.  In
particular, \verb|DA_STENCIL_STAR| indicates that ghosted points (information owned by a
different processor) will be needed only along the coordinate axes while
\verb|DA_STENCIL_BOX| indicates that ghosted points will be needed in the box shaped
region surrounding each point.  The stencil width indicates how many points in each
direction will be needed.  We never need a stencil width greater than 1 and only need BOX
style stencils when gradient terms must be evaluated on a staggered grid ($h$ in SIA
velocity and $\bar{u},\bar{v}$ in computation of effective viscosity in Macayeal
velocity).  Keeping all other two dimensional vectors on a STAR type stencil
would reduce the necessary communication slightly, but would complicate the code.  For this
reason, all two dimensional vectors are kept on a box type distributed array.

The three dimensional distributed arrays are aligned so that they have the same horizontal
extent as the associated two dimensional distributed array, but have complete vertical
extent. One point of confusion is the redefinition of the $x,y,z$ axes. Contrary to the
PETSc default, our $z$ axis changes most rapidly through memory while the $x$ axis changes
most slowly. That is, our C style arrays will be addressed as \texttt{u[i][j][k]} where
$\texttt{i,j,k}$ are the coordinate indices in the directions $x,y,z$ respectively.

DA-based vectors can be accessed by \texttt{DAVecGetArray()} and restored with
\texttt{DAVecRestoreArray()}. The resulting pointer should be addressed using normal
multidimensional array indexing where values range over the global array.

PETSc DA based vectors can be ``local'' or ``global''. Local vectors include space for the
ghosted points. That is, when \texttt{DAVecGetArray()} is called, the resulting array can
be indexed on all the ghosted points. However, all vector operations act only on the local
portion. \texttt{DALocalToLocalBegin()} and then \texttt{DALocalToLocalEnd()} should be
called to update the ghost points before they will be needed. Global vectors do not hold
ghosted values, but array operations will act on the entire vector. Hence local vectors
typically need to be mapped to global vectors before viewing or using in a linear system.
This is achieved with \texttt{DALocalToGlobal()}.

\subsubsection{Solving linear systems}
PETSc is designed for solving large, sparse systems in a distributed environment.
Iterative methods are the name of the game and especially Krylov subspace methods such as
conjugate gradients and GMRES. For consistency, all methods use the Krylov subspace
interface. For this, the user declares an object of type \texttt{KSP}. Various options can
be set and the preconditioner context can be extracted. PETSc has an options database
which holds command line options. To allow these options to influence the \t{KSP}, one
should call \t{KSPSetFromOptions()} prior to solving the system. The default method is
GMRES(30) with ILU preconditioning.

To solve the system, a matrix must be attached to the \t{KSP}. The first time
\t{KSPSolve()} is called, the matrix will be factored by the preconditioner and reused
when the system is called for additional right hand sides. The default matrix format is
similar to the Matlab \t{sparse} format. Each processor owns a range of rows. Elements in
matrices and vectors can be set using \t{MatSetValues()} and \t{VecSetValues()}. These
routines use the global indexing and can set values on any processor. The values are
cached until one calls \t{MatAssemblyBegin()} followed by \t{MatAssemblyEnd()} to
communicate the values.

In the Macayeal velocity computation, the solution and right hand side vectors are not DA
based.

The vector (field) components are interlaced and distributed. This seemed to be the
most straightforward method to solve the system (as opposed to using more advanced
features intended for multiple degrees of freedom on DA based vectors). This also allows
the matrix to have an optimal parallel layout.

\subsubsection{PETSc utility functions}
The \t{PetscViewer} interface allows PETSc objects to be displayed. This can be in binary
to disk, in plain text to the terminal, in graphical form to an X server, to a running
instance of Matlab, etc. Typically, one will want to view an entire vector, not just the
local portion, so DA based local vectors are mapped to global vectors before viewing.

When viewing multiprocessor jobs, the display may have to be set on the command line, for instance as
\t{-display :0} or similar; this must be given as the final option.  For example,

\verb|mpiexec -n 2 pismv -test C -Mx 101 -My 101 -Mz 31 -y 1000 -d HT -display :0|

\noindent views a two processor run of test C.

PETSc allows the programmer to access command line arguments at any time during program
execution. This is preferable to using \t{getopt.h} for this purpose.

Quite ellaborate error tracing and performance monitoring is possible with PETSc.  All
functions return \t{PetscErrorCode} which should be checked by the macro \t{CHKERRQ()}.
Normally, runtime errors print traceback information when the program exits.  If this
information is not present, you may need to use a debugger which is accessible with the
command line options \verb|-start_in_debugger| and \verb|-on_error_attach_debugger|.  Also
consider options such as \verb|-log_summary| to get diagnostics written to the terminal.

\section{PISM command line options}\label{sect:options}

Much of the behavior of PISM can be set at the command line by options.  For example, the command 

\verb|$  pismv -test C -Mx 61 -gk -e 1.2 -o foo|

\noindent includes five options ``\verb|-test|'', ``\verb|-Mx|'', ``\verb|-gk|'', ``\verb|-e|'', and ``\verb|-o|'',  The first of these options includes a single character argument, the second an integer argument, the third has no argument, the fourth has a floating point argument, and the fifth has a string argument.

The format of the option documentation below is

\centerline{``\optdefrestrict{optionname}{A}{B} Description.''}

\noindent Here ``A'' is the default value and ``\t{B}'' is a list of the allowed executables.  The option applies to all executables (\verb|pismr|, \verb|pisms|, \verb|pismv|) unless the allowed executables are specifically stated by giving ``[\t{B} \textsl{only}]''.

As PISM is a PETSc program, all PETSc options are available \cite{petsc-user-ref}.  See the next section, which recalls some of these PETSc options.
\bigskip

\optdef{adapt\und ratio}{0.12}  Adaptive time stepping ratio for the explicit scheme for the mass balance equation.

\opt{bed\und def\und iso} Compute bed deformations by simple pointwise isostasy.  Assumes that the bed at the starting time is in equilibrium with the load so the bed elevation is equal to the starting bed elevation minus a multiple of the increase in ice thickness from the starting time, roughly: $b(t,x,y) = b(0,x,y) - f [H(t,x,y) - H(0,x,y)]$.  Here $f$ is the density of ice divided by the density of the mantle.  See Test H in Verification section.

\opt{bed\und def\und lc} Compute bed deformations, caused by the changing load of the ice, using a viscoelastic earth model.  Uses the model and computational technique described in \cite{BLKfastearth}, based on the continuum model in \cite{LingleClark}.

\optrestrict{bif}{pismr, pgrn}  The model can be ``bootstrapped'' from certain NetCDF files with just the right information.  See section \ref{sect:real}.  Compare \verb|-if|.

\optrestrict{bif\und legacy}{pant}  The model can be ``bootstrapped'' from certain NetCDF files dealing with antarctica (\verb|init.nc|).

\opt{constant\und hardness}  If this option is used then the velocities in ice shelves and streams (see \verb|-mv| below) are computed with a constant, temperature-independent hardness parameter $\bar B$.  In particular, the viscous stress term in the $x$-component (for example) of the MacAyeal-Morland equations for ice shelves and ice streams is
	$$\ddx{}\left(2\nu H\left(2\ddx{u} + \ddy{v}\right)\right)$$
where 
	$$\nu = \frac{\bar B}{2} \left[\left(\ddx{u}\right)^2 + \left(\ddy{v}\right)^2 +
  \frac{1}{4} \left(\ddy{u} + \ddx{v}\right)^2 + \ddx{u}\ddy{v}\right]^{(1-n)/(2n)}.$$
Generally $\bar B$ is computed by a vertical-integral of a function of the temperature field.  If \verb|-constant_hardness| is used then $\bar B$ is set to the given value.

In the case of \verb|pismd -ross|, which performs the EISMINT Ross ice shelf intercomparison, a constant value $\bar B = 1.9 \times 10^8 \, \text{Pa}\, \text{s}^{1/3}$ is the default \cite{MacAyealetal}.

\optdef{constant\und nu}{30.0}  If this option is used then the velocities in ice shelves and streams (see \verb|-mv| below) are computed with a constant viscosity $\nu$; see the option \verb|-constant_hardness| above.  Generally the viscosity is computed by a nonlinear iteration.  With option \verb|-constant_nu|, this iteration does not occur.  If \verb|-constant_nu| is set then \verb|-constant_hardness| is ignored.  The argument is given in units of MPa a, and the default value is $30$ MPa a, the value given in \cite{Ritzetal2001}.

\optrestrict{ccl3}{pgrn -forcing}    Run EISMINT-GREENLAND climate control experiment. See section \ref{sect:real}

\opt{d}  Specifies diagnostic (X Windows) viewers.  See Appendix C.

\optdefrestrict{datprefix}{PISM}{pisms -ismip H}  Specify base name for ISMIP-HEINO deliverable \verb|.dat| files.  See also \verb|-no_deliver|.

\opt{dbig}  Specifies larger (about twice linear dimensions) diagnostic viewers.  See Diagnostic viewers section.

\optdef{e}{1.0}  Flow enhancement factor.

\optrestrict{eo}{pismv}  See section \ref{sect:verif}.

\optdefrestrict{eisII}{A}{pisms}  Choose single character name of EISMINT II \cite{EISMINT00} simplified geometry experiment.  Allowed values are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.

\optrestrict{force\und quarter\und year}{pisms -ismip H}  ISMIP-HEINO specifies rigid $0.25$ year time steps.  This will violate both the diffusivity and the CFL parts of the adaptive time-stepping scheme.  This option overrides the adaptime time-stepping and does $0.25$ year time steps anyway; \emph{will probably cause blowup so don't bother}.

\optrestrict{forcing}{pgrn}    Uses a NetCDF file to apply changes in surface temperature and sea level. See section \ref{sect:real}.

\optrestrict{gk}{pisms,pismr}  Sets the flow law to Goldsby-Kohlstedt.  Same as \verb|-law 4|.  See \verb|-law| for more complete option choice of flow law.

\optrestrict{gwl3}{pgrn}    Run EISMINT-GREENLAND greenhouse warming. See section \ref{sect:real}

\opt{id}  Sets the x grid index at which a sounding diagnostic viewer (section \ref{sect:viewers}) is displayed.  The integer argument should be in the range $0,\dots,\text{\t{Mx}}-1$.  The default is $(\text{\t{Mx}}-1)/2$ at the center of the grid.  For example, \verb|pismv -test G -d t -id 10|.

\opt{if}  The model can be initialized (restarted) from a NetCDF file \verb|foo.nc| written by the model, e.g.~\verb|foo.nc| from \verb|-o foo -of n|.  Compare \verb|-bif|.

\optdefrestrict{ismip}{H}{pisms}  Choose ISMIP simplified geometry experiment.  Only ``H'' for HEINO is allowed at this time.

\opt{isoflux}  Isothermal runs can be done by two methods.  One may simply initialize with a constant temperature field and then turn off temperature evolution (see \verb|-no_temp|); in this case the horizontal velocity and the horizontal mass flux are computed by a vertical numerical integral.  If the option \verb|-isoflux| is used then the mass flux is computed by the usual isothermal, Glen formula without reference to the temperature field or the chosen flow law.

\opt{jd}  Sets the y grid index at which a sounding diagnostic viewer (section \ref{sect:viewers}) is displayed.  The integer argument should be in the range $0,\dots,\text{\t{My}}-1$.  The default is $(\text{\t{My}}-1)/2$ at the center of the grid.  For example, \verb|pismv -test G -d t -jd 10|.

\optdef{kd}{0}  Sets the z grid index at which map-plane diagnositic views are shown.  Compare \verb|pismv -test G -Mz 101 -d T| and \verb|pismv -test G -Mz 101 -d T -kd 50|.  See section \ref{sect:viewers}.

\optdef{law}{0}  Allows choice of thermocoupled flow law.  The options are in table \ref{tab:flowlaw} below.  Note that a ``flow law'' here means the function $F(\sigma,T,P,d)$ in the relation
	$$\dot \eps_{ij} = F(\sigma,T,P,d)\, \sigma_{ij}'$$
where $\dot \eps_{ij}$ is the strain rate tensor, $\sigma_{ij}'$ is the stress deviator tensor, $T$ is the ice temperature, $\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{2} \|\sigma_{ij}'\|_F$ so $\sigma$ is the second invariant of the stress deviator tensor, $P$ is the pressure, and $d$ is the grain size.  That is, we are addressing isotropic flow laws only, and one can choose the scalar function.  Note that the inverse form of such a flow law in needed for ice shelves and ice streams:
	$$\sigma_{ij}' = 2 \nu(\dot\eps,T,P,d)\,\dot \eps_{ij} $$
Here $\nu(\dot \eps,T,P,d)$ is the effective viscosity.  The need for this inverse form of the flow law explains the ``hybrid'' law \verb|-law 4| (or \verb|-gk|).

\opt{Lx}  The x direction half-width of the computational box, in kilometers.  See section \ref{sect:usage}.

\opt{Ly}  The y direction half-width of the computational box, in kilometers.  See section \ref{sect:usage}.

\opt{Lz}  The height of the computational box for the ice (excluding the bedrock thermal model part).  See section \ref{sect:usage}.

\optdef{maxdt}{60.0}  The maximum time-step in years.  The adaptive time-stepping scheme will make the time-step shorter than this as needed for stability, but not longer.  See section \ref{sect:usage}.

\optdef{Mbz}{1}  Number of grid points in the bedrock for the bedrock thermal model.  The highest grid point corresponds to the base of the ice $z=0$, and so \t{Mbz}$>1$ is required to actually have bedrock thermal model.  Note this option is unrelated to the bed deformation model (glacial isostasy model); see option \verb|-bed_def| for that.

\optrestrict{Mmax}{pisms -eisII}  Set value of $M_{\text{max}}$ for EISMINT II.

\optdef{mu\und sliding}{3.17e-11}  The sliding law parameter in SIA regions of the ice.

\opt{mv}  Use the MacAyeal-Morland equations  \cite{MacAyeal} for ice shelves and dragging ice shelves (i.e.~ice streams) where so-indicated by the mask.  To view the mask use \verb|-d m|.

\optdef{mv\und eps}{1.0e15}  The numerical scheme for the MacAyeal-Morland equations computes an effective viscosity which which depends on velocity and temperature.  After that computation, this constant is added to the effective viscosity (to keep it bounded away from zero).  The units are kg $\text{m}^{-1}\,\text{s}^{-1}$. 

In fact there is a double regularization by default because the Schoof regularization mechanism described in equation (4.1) of \cite{SchoofStream} is also used.  Turn off this lower bound mechanise by \verb|-mv_eps 0.0| to exclusively use the Schoof regularization mechanism; see \verb|-reg_vel_schoof| and \verb|-reg_length_Schoof| below.  Note \verb|mv_eps| is set to zero automatically when running \verb|pismv -test I|.

\optdef{mv\und rtol}{1.0e-4}  The numerical scheme for the MacAyeal-Morland equations does a nonlinear iteration wherein velocities (and temperatures) are used to compute a vertically-averaged effective viscosity which is used to solve the equations for horizontal velocity.  Then the new velocities are used to recompute an effective viscosity, and so on.  This option sets the relative change tolerance for the effective viscosity.

In particular, the nonlinear part of the iteration requires that successive values $\nu^{(k)}$ of the vertically-averaged effective viscosity satisfy
	$$\frac{\|(\nu^{(k)} - \nu^{(k-1)}) H\|_2}{\|\nu^{(k)} H\|_2} \le \text{mv\und rtol}$$
in order to end the iteration with $\nu = \nu^{(k)}$.  See also \verb|-ksp_rtol|, a PETSc option below, as one may want to require a high relative tolerance for the linear iteration as well.

\optdef{Mx}{61}  Number of grid points in x horizontal direction.

\optdef{My}{61}  Number of grid points in y horizontal direction.

\optdef{Mz}{31}  Number of grid points in z (vertical) direction.

\opt{no\und mass}  Forces PISM not to change the ice thickness.  No time steps of the mass conservation equation are computed.

\optrestrict{noreport}{pismv}  Do not report errors at the end of a verification run.

\optdef{no\und spokes}{0}  The strain heating term can be smoothed by non-physical averaging the neighboring horizontal neighbors (those which are within the ice) \cite{BBL}.  The integer parameter controls the number of neighboring grid points over which the average is computed.  For instance, \verb|-no_spokes 0| is no smoothing while \verb|-no_spokes 3| is smoothing over the 3-neighborhood of horizontal grid points, that is, over a distance of \verb|3*dx|.

\opt{no\und temp}  Do not change temperature or age values within the ice.  That is, do not do time steps of energy conservation and age equation.

\optdef{o}{unnamed.nc} Give name of output file: \verb|-o foo| writes an output file named \verb|foo.nc|.  See the description of option \verb|-if|.  Default name is \verb|unnamed.nc| under \verb|pismr|, \verb|simp_exper.nc| under \verb|pisms|, and \verb|verify.nc| under \verb|pismv|.

\opt{ocean\und kill}  If used with input from a NetCDF initialization file which has ice-free ocean mask, will zero out ice thicknesses in areas that were ice-free ocean at time zero.  Has no effect when used in conjunction with \verb|-no_mass|.

\optdef{of}{n}  Format of output file(s).  Possible values are \verb|n| for model state written to a NetCDF file \verb|foo.nc| and \verb|m| for selected variables written to an ASCII Matlab file \verb|foo.m|.  PISM can be restarted using \verb|-if| from the output \verb|.nc| files.  Multiple files can be written, for instance, \verb|-o foo -of nm| writes both \verb|foo.nc| and \verb|foo.m|.

\opt{pdd}  Turns on the positive degree day model (which is off by default for \verb|pismr|, \verb|pisms|, and \verb|pismv|).  See subsection \ref{subsect:pdd}.

\optdef{pdd\und factor\und ice}{0.008}  The amount of ice, measured in meters, which is melted per positive degree day.  In units of $\text{m}\!\phantom{|}^\circ\text{C}^{-1}\text{day}^{-1}$.  See subsection \ref{subsect:pdd}.

\optdef{pdd\und factor\und snow}{0.003}  The amount of snow, measured in meters ice-equivalent, which is melted per positive degree day.  In units of $\text{m}\phantom{|}^\circ\text{C}^{-1}\text{day}^{-1}$.  See subsection \ref{subsect:pdd}.

\optdef{pdd\und refreeze}{0.6}  Fraction of melted snow, from positive degree day melting, which locally refreezes as ice (and therefore adds to accumulation).  See subsection \ref{subsect:pdd}.

\opt{pdd\und repeatable}  Base the randomness specified by \verb|pdd_std_dev| on a predictable seed.  Makes no difference if \verb|pdd_std_dev| is 0.0.  Allows runs with positive \verb|pdd_std_dev| to be identically repeated.  See subsection \ref{subsect:pdd}.

\optdef{pdd\und std\und dev}{0.0}  Standard deviation of temperature increment added each day to temperature cycle in positive degree day model.  Units of $\phantom{|}^\circ\text{C}$.  See subsection \ref{subsect:pdd}.

\optdef{pdd\und summer\und warming}{15.0}  Difference between peak summer temperature and mean annual temperature at each grid location.  Units of $\phantom{|}^\circ\text{C}$.  See subsection \ref{subsect:pdd}.

\optrestrict{pause}{pismd -ross,pismv -test I}    Pause for given number of seconds at the end of the run when the results are displayed.

\optdefrestrict{plastic\und reg}{0.01 m/a}{pismv -test I}    Set the value of $\eps$ regularization of plastic till; this is the second ``$\eps$'' in formula (4.1) in \cite{SchoofStream}.  See \t{src/iceExactStreamModel.cc}.

\opt{regrid}  See section \ref{sect:usage}.

\opt{regrid\und vars}  See section \ref{sect:usage}.

\optdef{reg\und length\und schoof}{1000 km}  Set the ``$L$'' in formula (4.1) in \cite{SchoofStream}.  To use the regularization described by Schoof, one must set \verb|-mv_eps 0.0| to turn off the other regularization mechanism, otherwise there is a double regularization.

\optdef{reg\und vel\und schoof}{1 m/a}  Set the \emph{first} ``$\eps$'' in formula (4.1) in \cite{SchoofStream}.  To use the regularization described by Schoof, one must set \verb|-mv_eps 0.0| to turn off the other regularization mechanism, otherwise there is a double regularization.

\section{PETSC command line options (for PISM users)}  All PETSc programs accept command line options which control the manner in which PETSc distributes jobs among parallel processors, how it solves linear systems, what additional information it provides, and so on.  The PETSc manual (\url{http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-as/snapshots/petsc-current/docs/manual.pdf}) is the complete reference on these options.  Here we list some that are perhaps most useful to PISM users.

\opt{da\und processors\und x}  Number of processors in x direction.

\opt{da\und processors\und y}  Number of processors in y direction.

\optdef{display}  As a \emph{final} option, \verb|-display :0| seems to frequently be needed to let PETSc use Xwindows when running multiple processes.

\opt{help}  Gives PISM help message and then a brief description of many PETSc options.

\opt{info}  Gives excessive information about PETSc operations during run.  Option \verb|-verbose| for PISM (above) is generally more useful, except possibly for debugging.

\optdef{ksp\und rtol}{1e-5}  For solving the ice stream and shelf equations with high resolution on multiple processors, it is recommended that this be tightened.  For example, 

\verb|$  mpiexec -n 8 pismv -test I -Mx 5 -My 769|

\noindent works poorly on a certain machine, but

\verb|$  mpiexec -n 8 pismv -test I -Mx 5 -My 769 -ksp_rtol 1e-10|

\noindent works fine.

\optdef{ksp\und type}{gmres}  Based on one processor evidence from \verb|pismv -test I|, the following are possible choices in the sense that they work and allow convergence at some reasonable rate: \t{cg}, \t{bicg}, \t{gmres}, \t{bcgs}, \t{cgs}, \t{tfqmr}, \t{tcqmr}, and \t{cr}.  It appears \t{bicg}, \t{gmres}, \t{bcgs}, and \t{tfqmr}, at least, are all among the best.

\opt{log\und summary}  At the end of the run gives a performance summary and also a synopsis of the PETSc configuration in use.

\optdef{pc\und type}{ilu}   Several options are possible, but for solving the ice stream and shelf equations we recommend only \t{bjacobi}, \t{ilu}, and \t{asm}.  Of these it is not currently clear which is fastest; they are all about the same for \verb|pismv -test I| with high tolerances (e.g.~\verb|-mv_rtol 1e-7| \verb|-ksp_rtol 1e-12|).

\opt{v}   Show version number of PETSc.

\section{PISM viewers}\label{sect:viewers}

Basic graphical views of the changing state of the ice model are available at the command line by using the options ``\t{-d}'' and ``\t{-dbig}'' with additional arguments.  For instance:

\verb|$  pismv -test G -d hTf -dbig 0|

\noindent shows a map-plane views of surface elevation (``\t{h}''), temperature at the level specified by \t{-kd} (``\t{T}''), rate of change of thickness (``\t{f}'') and of horizontal ice speed at the surface (``\t{0}'', i.e.~zero).

The option \t{-d} is followed by a space and then a list of single-character names of the diagnositic viewers.  The option \t{-dbig} works exactly the same way, with the same list of single-character names available.  The bigger viewers take precedence, so that ``\t{-d hT -dbig T}'' shows only two viewers, namely a regular size viewer for surface elevation and a larger viewer for temperature.

The single character diagnostic viewer names are:

\verb|0|:\quad Map-plane view of horizontal ice speed (magnitude of velocity) at the surface of the ice in meters per year.

\verb|1|:\quad Map-plane view of $x$-component of horizontal ice velocity at the surface of the ice in meters per year.
