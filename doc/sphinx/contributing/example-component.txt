Adding a new PISM component
===========================

This section describes the implementation of a simple ocean model component.

Most of PISM's sub-models are derived from the abstract class `Component`. This class
contains data members used in most sub-models and defines a common interface.

Each sub-model has to be able to do the following.

#. Initialize using an input file.

   This can be trickier than you would think, especially when implementing a
   *time-stepping* model.

   As mentioned elsewhere in this manual, PISM supports two kinds of initialization:

   #. Re-starting from the model state saved by PISM.
   #. Initializing from a possibly incomplete model state using heuristics to replace
      missing data. (This is what we call "bootstrapping".)

   In both cases the user can choose to read a part of the model state from a different
   file, interpolating from a different grid if necessary (this is what we call
   "regridding").

   All components need to support both kinds of initialization as well as regridding.

   .. note::

      When the grid chosen for a given simulation matches the one in the input file
      *re-starting* using the command-line option `-i input.nc` has to produce a model
      state equivalent to the one obtained using *bootstrapping* followed by *regridding*:
      `-i input.nc -bootstrap -regrid_file input.nc`.

   Getting initialization right is especially challenging in sub-models using time steps
   different from PISM's mass-continuity time step. See `pism::earth::LingleClark` for an
   example of a model like this.

   Each new component should have a regression test ensuring that it can be stopped and
   re-started without affecting results. Add an initialization method setting the state of
   the model using provided `array::Array` instances: this makes writing such test much
   easier.

#. Save its model state to an output file.

   To avoid a performance penalty when saving to a NetCDF-3 file this is performed in two
   steps:

   #. Define NetCDF variables, creating the file structure.
   #. Write data to the file.

#. Time-stepping sub-models need to provide the maximum allowable time step length at a
   given model time.

#. Provide lists of spatially-variable and scalar (time-series) diagnostics.
