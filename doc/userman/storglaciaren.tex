Storglaci{\"a}ren is a small valley glacier in northern Sweden (Figure~\ref{fig:storglaciaren}). The glacier is approximately 3.2\,km long and 1\,km wide, therefore much smaller than a single grid cell in a typical Greenland model. By the way ``Storglaci{\"a}ren'' means ``big glacier'' in Swedish. Most of the glacier is temperate, except for a thin cold near-surface layer in the ablation zone. Such a thermal structure is often-called a Scandinavian-type structure. Thanks to the nearby Tarfala research station it is one of the best investigated glaciers worldwide, and the wealth of data available makes it perfectly suitable for all kinds of modeling studies. In this tutorial we demonstrate how PISM can be used for valley glaciers, both in a 3-dimensional and a flow-line application. Additionally we show that PISM's conservation of energy scheme is able to simulate the glacier's polythermal structure.

The script \texttt{preprocess.sh} in \texttt{examples/storglaciaren} reads the digital elevation model from ASCII files and generates the necessary input files for both the 3-dimensional and the flow-line application. 

The mean annual air temperature $T_{\mathrm{MA}}=-5^{\circ}$C at the nearby Tarfala Research Stations serves as the boundary condition for the conservation of energy scheme below the firn line. Above it, where the ice is temerate, we choose 0$^{\circ}$C. 



\texttt{psg_flowline.sh} runs the flow-line application mode. The aim here model the steady-state configuration of the glacier given the following climatic conditions: \texttt{-surface elevation -acab -2.5,3.5,1100,1450,1660 -acab_limits -2.5,0}


FIXME: Numerics of the flow-line application can make the KSP solver fail to converge. Compiling PETSc with a direct solver like mumps helps. The SSA doesn't know about grounded glaciers.
